# Morgan Qualification Patterns (v1.0)
# "The Velvet Rope"

Qualification is about disqualifying the wrong people quickly and advancing the right ones.

## 1. The ICP Check
**Goal**: Confirm they match the Ideal Customer Profile.
- **Pattern**: "Just to make sure I'm not wasting your time, are you currently handling [Process] manually or using software?"
- **Logic**:
    - If "Manual" -> **High Fit** (Pain is likely).
    - If "Competitor Software" -> **Medium Fit** (Need differentiation).
    - If "Don't know" -> **Low Fit** (Not the decision maker).

## 2. The Pain Probe
**Goal**: Twist the knife (gently).
- **Pattern**: "A lot of [Role]s I speak to say that [Pain Point] is their biggest headache. Is that true for you too?"
- **Logic**:
    - If "Yes" -> **Qualified**. Move to Pitch.
    - If "No, we're fine" -> **Disqualify** or Pivot to secondary pain.

## 3. The Authority Check
**Goal**: Ensure we aren't pitching an intern.
- **Pattern**: "Who else would need to be involved to make a decision on this?"
- **Logic**:
    - If "Just me" -> **Green Light**.
    - If "My boss" -> **Yellow Light** (Ask to include boss in demo).

## 4. Disqualification
- If they say "We have zero budget" -> politely exit.
- If they are rude -> politely exit.
- **Exit Phrase**: "Totally understand. It sounds like this isn't a fit right now. I'll take you off our list. Have a great day!"
