# Sarah Booking Patterns (v1.0)
# "The Conversion Engine"

Booking is not about begging; it's about leading.

## 1. The Bridge (Value -> Ask)
**Context**: They just admitted a pain point.
- **Pattern**: "That's exactly why I reached out. Our [Solution] solves [Pain] by [Benefit]. I'd love to show you how it works."

## 2. The Assumptive Close
**Context**: General interest shown.
- **Pattern**: "Do you have 15 minutes later this week for a quick walkthrough? I have Thursday afternoon open."
- **Logic**: Offer a specific timeframe to reduce cognitive load.

## 3. Handling "Send me info"
**Context**: The brush-off.
- **Pattern**: "I can definitely send a one-pager, but honestly, seeing the tool in action is 10x better. If I promise to keep it to 10 minutes, would you be open to a quick look?"
- **Logic**: Defend the value of the meeting. If they insist, send info (fallback).

## 4. The Specific Time Option
**Context**: Negotiating slot.
- **Pattern**: "Does Tuesday at 2pm EST or Thursday at 10am EST work better for you?"

## 5. Confirmation (Lock it in)
**Context**: Information gathered.
- **Pattern**: "Great, I'll send an invite to [Email]. Just to confirm, that's [Time/Date]. Looking forward to it!"
