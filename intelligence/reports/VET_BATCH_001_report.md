## 🔥 A-Tier Leads (Contact Immediately)

### 1. North Star Animal Hospital
- **URL:** https://www.northstaranimalhospital.com/
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Location:** Alaska
- **Pain Signal:** 📞 Manual Phone Intake
- **Why A-Tier:** Small local practice, mentions "Personal and Compassionate Care" - not using advanced tech, likely overwhelmed with calls

**📧 Draft Email:**

> **Subject:** Your phones might be costing you $2k/month, North Star
>
> Hi there,
>
> I noticed North Star Animal Hospital emphasizes personal care - which means your team is probably spending hours on phone triage when pet parents call about "Is this an emergency?"
>
> We built a quick demo showing how an AI triage assistant could handle those calls 24/7 while you focus on actual patients.
>
> Worth a 5-minute look? [DEMO_LINK]

**Contact to Find:** Owner/Practice Manager via Hunter.io or LinkedIn

- **URL:** https://www.stonybrookhomevet.com/
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Location:** Pennington, NJ
- **Pain Signal:** 📞 Manual Phone, House-Call Model
- **Why A-Tier:** House-call vet = solo practitioner = VERY overwhelmed with scheduling

**📧 Draft Email:**

> **Subject:** House call scheduling eating your weekends?
>
> Hi,
>
> House-call vets are the hardest working people in the business - but also the most phone-dependent.
>
> I built something that could schedule your house calls while you're on the road. No more "let me call you back when I'm between appointments."
>
> 5-minute demo: [DEMO_LINK]
