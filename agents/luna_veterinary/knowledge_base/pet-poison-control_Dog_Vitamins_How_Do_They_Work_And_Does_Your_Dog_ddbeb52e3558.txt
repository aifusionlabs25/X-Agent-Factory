View 5 More + As a responsible pet parent, you are always trying to make sure your dog is as healthy as possible. The right diet , exercise , a cozy place to sleep , and lots of love are important needs, but should that list include a dog vitamin as well? Giving your pup a dog multivitamin should be considered in certain circumstances, depending on many different factors about their health and lifestyle. Key Takeaways Most dogs eating an AAFCO-certified commercial diet don’t need multivitamins, but supplements may help in specific cases like joint disease or skin issues. Common dog supplements include multivitamins, glucosamine for joints, and omega-3 fatty acids for inflammation, skin, and brain health. Always consult a veterinarian before giving your dog any supplement, as some—like human vitamins—can be toxic or interfere with medications. What Are Dog Vitamins? Dog vitamins are a type of nutritional supplement used to provide nutrients and help certain bodily functions. It’s estimated that up to 33% of dogs (and cats !) are on a supplement or vitamin product in addition to their regular diet, according to this study . Vitamins give an extra boost of an organic compound that might already be in your pet’s food that is needed for the body’s normal metabolism. These nutrients are very important for a healthy immune system, digestive system, and nervous system, and they can play a vital role in preventing and treating certain diseases. Vitamin and supplement use in dogs is on the rise, according to this study , but it’s important to speak to your veterinarian before adding them to your dog’s health regimen to ensure they are safe for your pet. Types of Dog Vitamins The most common vitamins and supplements given to dogs in the U.S. are multivitamins, joint protectants such as glucosamine , and fatty acid supplements, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). Choosing to give a supplement or not should be based off its potential benefit versus possible side effects. It’s also important to make sure the product comes from good, quality-controlled ingredients and manufacturers. Looking for the NASC seal is an indication that a supplement is safe for dogs—but always check with your veterinarian before giving anything new to your dog. Multivitamins are a way to bridge the gap between a dog’s diet and what they need to be healthy. They usually have a combination of vitamins A, B, C, D (low dose), E, and K, and minerals like calcium, phosphorus, and iron. An example is Pet-Tabs Plus . As long as your dog is on an AAFCO -certified diet meant for their life stage (puppy, adult, or senior), then multivitamins are not needed. Joint protectant supplements are great to not only help dogs that have mobility issues such as arthritis but also to help prevent issues when started young and given routinely. Glucosamine and chondroitin, along with MSM (like in Dasuquin ), hyaluronic acid, eggshell membrane (like in Movoflex ), and omega-3 fatty acids have all been shown to help protect against joint disease. Fatty acid supplements are known to have anti-inflammatory effects on the body with their omega-3 fish oils. They are used for their positive effects on the skin/coat, immune system, nervous system, and brain and heart function. Fish oils EPA and DHA (like in Welactin ) are also known to help a dog’s joints by reducing both pain and inflammation (swelling) from arthritis and other joint disease. What Vitamins and Supplements Does Your Dog Need? What vitamins and supplements your dog needs depends on many factors, such as age, lifestyle, diet, and health conditions. Luckily, with most commercial pet foods, AAFCO sets standards for labeling and nutritional requirements to make sure they provide the vitamins and nutrients your dog needs to be healthy. You can find the AAFCO statement list on those foods that have been evaluated, and it will let you know which life stage the diet is made for ( puppy , adult , or senior ). If your dog’s diet has the AAFCO labeling, then it has everything they need and multivitamins are unnecessary. Multivitamins are needed for specially formulated, home-cooked diets that are made for dogs with specific health concerns. Other supplements, such as joint protectants and omega-3 fatty acids, are often given based on your dog’s breed or ongoing health concerns. Large-breed dogs and those with orthopedic disease benefit from joint supplements, while dogs that have skin issues such as allergies often take fatty acid supplements. Benefits of Dog Vitamins Multivitamins help supplement a dog’s diet where it might be lacking. When dogs with serious food allergies are on a home-cooked diet, multivitamins help them get the nutrients they are missing that are normally in commercial dog food. While specific vitamins, such as vitamin A or B, might be recommended to supplement a diet to help with medical conditions, vitamin D is actually a potential toxin to dogs. All vitamins and supplements should be given under the direction of your dog’s veterinarian. Risks and Side Effects of Dog Vitamins The risks of dogs taking vitamins are often limited to the side effects they might cause. Gastrointestinal upset — vomiting , diarrhea , decreased appetite —are among the most common side effects of giving vitamins to dogs. Allergic reactions can occur to any vitamin supplement and are usually not predictable unless your dog has had a reaction to similar ingredients in the past. Vitamins can also have interactions with any medications your dog might already be on, so it’s important to check with your vet before giving your pup anything new. It’s important that all vitamin supplements used for dogs are specifically labeled for canine use. Human vitamins might contain the same ingredients, but the amounts are vastly different. For example, both humans and pets can take vitamin D, but if a dog takes a human vitamin D supplement, it can cause fatal kidney damage . When Do Veterinarians Recommend Dog Vitamins? Dog vitamins and supplements are given to help boost the pet’s health and provide support for any ongoing medical issues. Itchy skin and inflammation from allergies often improve with omega-3 fatty acids, as they contribute to the skin’s moisture barrier, which reduces inflammation and helps to promote a shiny, healthy coat. Vitamin B12 is often recommended for dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as they often have low blood levels from not absorbing the vitamin directly from the diet. A B12 deficiency in dogs can lead to various health problems, including lethargy , loss of appetite, weight loss , poor coat quality, and even neurological issues . Dog Vitamins FAQs What is the best multivitamin for dogs? A good multivitamin for dogs is one that has a variety of vitamins and minerals that dogs need to be healthy. They should also be tasty so that they are easy to give your dog. Should dogs take multivitamins? Dogs that are on a commercially available, well-balanced, and complete diet do not need multivitamins. Do vets recommend dog vitamins? In general, vets do not recommend multivitamins for dogs unless there is a specific medical condition causing your dog’s body to not properly use the minerals and vitamins in their diet. Other supplements, such as glucosamine and omega-3 fatty acids, are commonly recommended by vets for prevention and treatment of a variety of medical conditions. What human multivitamin can I give my dog? No human multivitamins should ever be given to dogs under any circumstances! Human multivitamins have higher levels of vitamins that can make dogs very ill. They can also have vitamins that are toxic or even fatal to dogs. Do dog vitamins work? Dogs do not need separate multivitamins if they are on a complete and balanced diet, as they get what they need from their food. Under certain circumstances, vitamin supplementation can do more harm than good. Other supplements, such as joint supplements and fatty acids, do have a scientific basis for their recommendation and do work to help dogs with various medical conditions. WRITTEN BY Barri J.
