Can Dogs Have Beer?

Humans have been brewing and drinking alcohol for centuries. The
oldest known archeological evidence
dates the practice of beer brewing by ancient humans starting about 13,000 years ago.
Similarly, the domestication of dogs is estimated to have occurred 15,000–40,000 years ago. In short: Dogs, humans, and beer have been together for a long time.
However, while humans should always drink alcohol responsibly, dogs should not be allowed to drink alcohol of any kind, as this could lead to alcohol poisoning.
Key Takeaways
Dogs should never consume beer or any type of alcohol. Even small amounts can lead to serious poisoning.
Signs of alcohol poisoning in dogs may include lethargy, unsteady walking, and/or difficulty breathing.
To prevent accidental poisoning, keep drinks out of reach or make sure your dog doesn’t have access to any area where alcohol is consumed.
If your dog ingested alcohol, contact your vet or the Pet Poison Helpline for next steps.
Can Dogs Have Beer?
No. Dogs should not be allowed to drink beer or any other alcoholic beverage. Although the percentage of alcohol in beer is lower than other alcoholic drinks, ingesting even a small amount of alcohol may pose a risk your dog.
When consumed by a dog, the ethanol in alcohol is rapidly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized by the liver. It readily crosses into the brain, disrupting the normal balance between various neurotransmitters.
This disruption decreases neurological functions, including respiration (breathing) and locomotion (any type of movement, including walking).
Symptoms of alcohol poisoning in dogs generally occur within the first 15 minutes to two hours after ingestion.
Do Dogs Like Beer?
Whether or not dogs actually like beer or are interested in the smell is debatable.
Some believe dogs are attracted to beer thanks to its sweet taste. Another thought is that dogs like beer due to the underlying aromas masked by ethanol, including the smell of hops or malt.
Dogs who routinely receive
table scraps as treats
may be more interested in beer and other alcoholic beverages, because they want whatever their human family members are enjoying.
Symptoms of Alcohol Poisoning in Dogs
Common signs to watch for may include:
Sedation/
lethargy
Ataxia
(walking in an unsteady, weak, awkward, uncoordinated, or clumsy manner)
Seizures
(triggered by low blood sugar)
An upset stomach
Slower or more shallow breathing, sometimes to the point of becoming comatose
Respiratory failure that can lead to death
My Dog Drank Beer. Now What?
As with all poisoning cases, early intervention is key to successfully treating alcohol poisoning in your dog.
Call your veterinarian or the
Pet Poison Helpline
, a 24/7 animal poison control center, at 1-855-764-7661 as soon as you realize your dog has consumed alcohol.
Specific pet information, including their
weight
and
breed
, as well as an estimate of the amount of alcohol ingested are helpful in determining the your dog’s risk.
Do not
induce vomiting
at home
unless you have been directed to do so by a veterinarian. Typical treatment for alcohol poisoning may include
blood work
, monitoring vital signs, temperature regulation, plus symptomatic and supportive care.
Prevention of Alcohol Poisoning in Dogs
To prevent alcohol poisoning, keep alcoholic products away from dogs in a secure space and monitor open containers.
Discourage guests from sharing their beer or other alcoholic beverages with dogs. Consider keeping your pup in a
crate
,
playpen
, or
gated
area when hosting parties. Especially if there are open punch bowls or other forms of large containers holding alcohol.
Avoid spillage as best as possible, since dogs are notoriously fast at ingesting items spilled onto floors or the ground.
Dog-Safe Beer Products
Breweries and retailers now offer craft drinks for pet parents who want their dogs to still have fun while consuming their own party beverages. You can also serve your pup a dog-safe broth as a
food topper
.
If you want to skip a dog-friendly drink option, your pup can still have fun with their own
beer-themed toy
or
beer print bandana
.
