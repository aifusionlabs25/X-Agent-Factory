Pets and disasters Disasters can vary widely in scale, severity, and impact. No matter where you live, disasters and emergencies can and will occur. By being prepared with a disaster plan, you are helping advance your safety, the safety of your animals, and that of first responders. Being prepared means: Making a disaster plan for your family and pets Preparing everything you need to execute that plan—such as putting together an evacuation kit for every member of your household (including all pets) Staying informed about local animal disaster plans Preparing for disaster Considerations when making your disaster plan: Locate and pre-arrange an evacuation site that would be outside the impacted area. Know how you plan to transport your pets during an evacuation event, and practice evacuating with all pets and their supplies. Assemble an animal evacuation kit . Keep animal equipment where rescue personnel, neighbors, and friends can easily find it. Collect records to help care for your pet during a disaster, such as vaccination records, medical records, and proof of ownership, and know how to access them. Consider including a signed veterinary medical treatment authorization with your evacuation kit. This will help your veterinarian provide care if your pet must be treated during your absence. Designate a friend or neighbor to care for your pets in the event a disaster occurs when you are not at home. Provide your friend or neighbor a letter signed by you that will release them from responsibility if a pet is injured during an evacuation and that tells them the location of your evacuation kit. Be ready to reunite in case you are separated from your pet. Ensure your pet has proper identification and that microchip and other ID information is up to date. Remember: Bring all pets indoors at the first sign of a potential disaster situation so all pets are accounted for if you need to evacuate.

You may need it during a disaster or while evacuating, and rescue personnel responding to a disaster affecting your pets may need it, too. Keep a copy with your evacuation kit. Include addresses and 24-hour contact numbers, if available. If you use the Medical ID function on your mobile device, be sure one of the contacts is aware of your pet disaster plan. A thorough emergency contact list includes: Numbers where you can be reached Location of your prearranged evacuation sites Local emergency contact person if you aren’t available Out-of-state emergency contact person Your veterinarian’s name, clinic name, and phone number Alternate veterinarian (30-90 miles away, provides boarding) Boarding facility (local) Boarding facility (30-90 miles away) Hotels that allow pets (90-mile radius) Local animal control agency Local police department Local fire department Local public health department Local Red Cross chapter List of internet and social media “lost and found” animal sites Local municipal animal shelter, local humane society, or local society for the prevention of cruelty to animals (SPCA) Download emergency contact cards for pets and livestock (Spanish and English) add Recovering after a disaster Follow these tips to help your pets recover after a disaster situation: Survey the area inside and outside your home to identify sharp objects, dangerous materials, dangerous wildlife, contaminated water, downed power lines, or other hazards. Examine your animals closely, and contact your veterinarian immediately if you observe injuries or signs of illness. Remember that familiar scents and landmarks may have changed, and this can confuse your animals. Release cats, dogs, and other small animals indoors only. They could encounter dangerous wildlife and debris if allowed outside unsupervised and unrestrained. Release birds and reptiles only if necessary and only when they are calm and in an enclosed room. Reintroduce food in small servings, gradually working up to full portions if animals have been without food for a prolonged period of time. Allow uninterrupted rest and sleep to allow animals to recover from the trauma and stress. The disruption of routine activities can be the biggest cause of stress for your pets, so try to re-establish a normal schedule as quickly as you can. Comfort each other. The simple act of petting and snuggling can reduce anxiety for both people and pets. If you notice any signs of stress, discomfort, or illness in your pets, contact your veterinarian to schedule a checkup. What to do if your animals are lost: Physically check animal control and animal shelters DAILY for lost animals. Some emergency response agencies may also use social media (Facebook, etc.) to post information about lost and found animals. Post waterproof lost animal notices and notify local law enforcement, animal care and control officials, veterinarians, and your neighbors of any lost animals (utilize online resources for lost and found animals). If your animal is lost and has a microchip, notify the microchip registry that your animal is missing. add Disaster resources for veterinarians AVMA resources help veterinary teams be prepared for any kind of emergency.
