Millions of people are bitten by dogs each year in the United States. Of these, hundreds of thousands seek medical attention. About half of dog bite victims are children. Home service providers like mail carriers or meter readers are also common targets. Fortunately, there are several things we can do to prevent dog bites. Why do dogs bite? Dogs bite for a variety of reasons, but most commonly as a reaction to a specific situation: Defending themselves or their territory Feeling scared or startled Sensing a threat Guarding something valuable to them, like their puppies, their food, or a toy Feeling unwell or in pain, as when sick or injured Dogs also might nip and bite during play.

It's more important to address the factors that we know increase the chance of a bite occurring. Choose wisely. Start off your relationship on the right foot by choosing a dog that will fit well with you, your lifestyle, and your household, including other pets. Find helpful tips on selecting a dog here . Socialize your dog. Gradually exposing your puppy to a variety of situations under controlled circumstances can help them feel more at ease when around other animals and people. It's even better if you continue that exposure on a regular basis as your dog gets older. Take extra care with young children. Always supervise young children when around dogs, no matter how well behaved either are. Also carefully manage introductions of children or a new dog to your household, and consider waiting until your children are older than 4 years before adopting a new dog. Train your dog. The basic commands "sit," "stay," "no," and "come" can be incorporated into fun activities that build a bond of obedience and trust between pets and people. Avoid highly excitable games like wrestling or tug-of-war, which can increase the risk of a nip or a bite. Use a leash in public to maintain control of your dog. Keep your dog healthy. Have your dog vaccinated against rabies and other serious or common infectious diseases. Parasite control and regular checkups are important because how dogs feel can affect how they behave. Dogs in pain are more likely to bite. Also be sure to regularly walk and exercise your dog to support their health and provide mental stimulation. Take precautions. Obey leash laws. If you have a fenced yard, make sure the gates are secure. It also may help to spay or neuter your dog , and your veterinarian can walk you through the benefits and risks of these procedures. Be alert. Know the signs that your dog is stressed, uncomfortable, or showing aggression, and be prepared to take action when needed. If your dog seems uneasy, remove them from the situation to reduce the risk of biting. If signs of fear or aggression seem unprovoked or excessive, consult a veterinarian to determine the cause and seek treatment. Preventing dog bites to delivery personnel Socialize and train your dog to be calm around strangers. Keep your dog secured in a separate room, crate, or fenced area when expecting a delivery. Use signage like "Beware of dog" or "Dog on premises" on your door or property to warn delivery personnel. If possible, notify delivery services ahead of time about your dog and any special instructions for delivering packages to your home. Set up a designated area for deliveries in a location your dog can't get to. add Protecting yourself and your family Be cautious around strange dogs and treat your own pet with respect. Because children are the most common victims of dog bites, parents and caregivers should keep these tips in mind: Never leave a baby or small child alone with a dog. Be alert for potentially dangerous situations, and take measures to prevent or stop them from escalating. Teach children—including toddlers—to be careful around and respectful of pets. Teach children not to approach strange dogs or try to pet dogs by reaching through fences. Teach your children to ask permission from the dog's owner before petting any dog. Here are other tips for preventing dog bites: Ask the owner for permission when greeting an unfamiliar dog. Approach slowly and calmly when meeting a new dog, and don't loom over them. Avoid direct eye contact with unfamiliar dogs or approaching them straight on, as this may seem threatening. Don't run past a dog. Dogs naturally love to chase and catch things. Don't give them a reason to become excited or aggressive. Never disturb a dog that's caring for puppies, sleeping, or eating. Never reach through or over a fence to pet a dog. Dogs can be protective of their territory and may interpret your action as a threat. If a dog approaches to sniff you, stay still. In most cases, the dog will go away when they determine you are not a threat. If you feel threatened by a dog, try to remain calm. Don't scream or yell. If you say anything, speak calmly and firmly. Avoid eye contact. Try to stay still until the dog leaves, or back away slowly until the dog is out of sight. Don't turn and run. If you fall or are knocked to the ground, curl into a ball with your hands over your head and neck. Protect your face. add Reading dog body language We all know that dogs can’t talk to us, so they use their own vocalizations, body gestures and postures to express themselves. They rely on these types of communication to let people and other dogs know their emotions, especially if they feel stressed, frightened or threatened. They hope that the gestures will work to calm the situation and keep them out of trouble. We can’t always read a dog’s body language accurately. Dogs, just like people, have their own, unique personalities, and they don’t all express themselves in the same way. One dog wagging its tail might mean that the animal is happy to see you or wants to play. The same gesture in another dog might mean that it’s anxious or nervous. Sometimes, dogs will yawn, put their ears back or raise a paw if they are feeling worried. As the dog gets more concerned about the situation it’s in, its behavior will change. For example, if a dog tucks its tail under its belly or leg, lies down with a leg up or stiffens its body and stares at you, it could be trying to tell you that it’s frightened or threatened. When the dog reacts by growling, snapping or biting, it’s telling you that it wants to be left alone – Right now! Remember, we can’t predict whether a dog will bite or not based on its size and breed. Always focus on the behavior of the animal. Ask yourself a question next time you’re around a dog and want to play with it: Does the dog seem like it wants to be with you? If the dog is relaxed and friendly, and seems happy to see you, it’s probably in a good, playful mood and will welcome your attention. If the dog won’t look at you or is avoiding you by walking or turning away, it’s probably best to let it go on its way and leave it alone. If it seems tense and nervous, or seems to be staring at you, you’ll want to stay away. If it’s not your dog, always rely on its owner to help you understand the pet’s mood. Always, always ask the owner’s permission before you attempt to pet a dog you don’t know. add Responding to a dog bite What do I do if I’m bitten? If you are bitten by a dog, here is a checklist of things you should do: If the dog's owner is present, request proof of rabies vaccination, and get the owner's name and contact information. Clean the bite wound with soap and water as soon as possible. Consult your doctor immediately or go to the emergency room if it's after office hours. Contact the dog's veterinarian to check vaccination records. What do I do if my dog bites someone? Dog bites are scary for everyone involved – the person who has been bitten, the dog owner and even the dog. If your dog happens to bite someone, remember that you are responsible to help the person who has been bitten and to remove your dog from the situation. What should you do if the unfortunate happens? Restrain your dog immediately. Separate your dog from the scene of the bite. Try to confine your dog in a safe place. Check on the bite victim’s condition. Make sure that the wounds are washed with soap and water. Encourage the bite victim to seek professional medical advice to check on the seriousness of the wound and the risk of rabies or other infections. Call 911 if a response by paramedics is needed. Provide important information. Give the bite victim – or others who are with the person at the time of the incident – your name, address and phone number, as well as information about your dog’s most recent rabies vaccination . Obey local rules and laws regarding reporting of dog bites. Talk to your veterinarian for advice about dog behavior that will help prevent similar incidents in the future. add AVMA member toolkit Get ready-to-use materials to celebrate National Dog Bite Prevention Week® in your clinic.
