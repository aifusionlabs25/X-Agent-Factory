Your veterinarian
As a pet owner you're part of a team, along with your veterinarian and the other professionals in their veterinary practice. Look to your veterinarian to develop a relationship with you and your pet, and to provide specific recommendations tailored to your individual pet's needs. Your veterinarian is an invaluable source of information both in the medical sphere and in other areas related to pet care, such as behavior, grooming, nutrition, and more.
