Wildlife decision tree
What does your veterinary team do when someone brings in a sick or injured wild animal? What about calls pertaining to wildlife? Does everyone in the practice know their role and know where to find contact information for wildlife authorities in your area?
This decision tree provides a guide to help your practice navigate the complexities associated with treating wildlife species or their hybrids. It helps you take care of the issues peripheral to the animal so that you can focus on treating the animal appropriately. And always remember: While it may not be mentioned in every topic, personal safety and the safety of other team members, clients, and patients must be considered at all times.
To access more detailed information on any topic, simply follow the links in the chart as you work your way through it.
