What Is Stomach Pain in Cats?

We know how miserable a stomachache can be, and we assume it’s no less miserable for our pets. Our cats can’t tell us when their stomach hurts, so it’s hard for pet parents to know when stomach pain is the cause of their cat’s symptoms.
Luckily, vets diagnosis cats with stomach pain frequently enough to figure it out for you.
Often, the underlying cause for stomach pain requires emergency management.
If your cat is showing any discomfort when you touch their tummy or if they have any of the symptoms below, contact your veterinarian immediately.

What Is Stomach Pain in Cats?
Although the stomach is a specific organ, when we say stomach pain, we generally mean any cause of pain in the cat’s abdomen. Stomach pain in cats might also be referred to as a painful abdomen, abdominal pain, or an acute abdomen.
A painful abdomen or stomach pain in cats can be caused by health issues affecting organs or areas of the cat’s stomach including:
Intestines
Pancreas
Peritoneum (lining of abdominal cavity)
Reproductive tract
Liver
Spleen
Gall bladder
Urinary tract
If your cat responds to having their belly touched with extreme tensing, yowling, or other signs of pain, it’s best to take them to the emergency room. It’s better to rule those emergency causes of stomach pain (such as a twisted intestine or organ) as soon as possible instead of taking a wait-and-see approach.
Symptoms of Stomach Pain in Cats
Symptoms of stomach in pain in cats may include:
Restlessness or refusing to move
Guarding of the abdomen
Arched back
Distended abdomen
Yowling when the abdomen is touched or when they’re picked up
Lying on their side and yowling
Vomiting
or retching
Diarrhea
Loss of appetite
Excessive salivation
Straining in the litter box
Yowling in the litter box
Pale gums
Why Does My Cat Have Stomach Pain?
Stomach pain in cats has a wide variety of causes, some of which are quite serious. All causes require immediate medical attention.
Some causes, particularly those toward the top of this list, require emergency treatment.
Twisting of intestines or other organs in the abdomen
Telescoping of intestines where a portion of the intestine slides inside itself
Organs getting stuck in a hernia (hole through the abdominal wall muscles)
Peritonitis
(inflammation of abdominal lining, often due to infection/sepsis)
A tear or puncture of the stomach or intestines
Block or ruptured gall bladder
Blocked urinary tract
Ruptured or
infected uterus (pyometra)
Foreign object stuck in the stomach or
intestines
Pancreatitis
Hepatitis
Gastroenteritis (irritation of the stomach and intestines) caused by infections, parasites, new medications, or eating something they shouldn’t
Constipation
Issues outside of the abdomen can sometimes mimic abdominal pain. For example, a cat with a back injury may also yowl in pain when you try to pick them up.
Your veterinarian can differentiate true abdominal pain from pain originating outside the abdomen.
How Veterinarians Diagnose Stomach Pain in Cats
Your veterinarian will typically be able to tell that your cat has a painful abdomen during their physical examination. They’ll most likely want to order more tests to determine the underlying cause of stomach pain in your cat including:
X-rays of the abdomen
Ultrasound of the abdomen
Blood work and analysis of urine
Collection of abdominal fluid to test for sepsis
Fecal testing if diarrhea is present
Treatment of Stomach Pain in Cats
Many causes of stomach pain in cats require surgery. Examples of causes that may require surgery include:
Twisted organs within the abdomen
, which could require placement of organs back to their normal location.
Organ entrapment in a hernia
, which would necessitate placing the organs back into the abdominal cavity and closing the hernia.
Peritonitis
, in which surgery usually entails flushing out the abdomen and addressing any known source of the peritonitis, such as a tear in the intestines.
Ruptured or infected uterus
, with surgery to remove the organ.
Foreign object stuck in the intestines
, which must be removed.
If your cat is severely dehydrated, collapsing, or has other issues, your veterinarian will likely want to stabilize them with fluids and pain medications prior to surgery.
Immediately life-threatening causes of abdominal pain, such as twisted intestines that are losing blood flow, may lead the veterinarian to pursue surgery prior to full stabilization.
Some cases, such as a foreign object in the intestines, may allow for time to stabilize the cat and give them the best chance of a successful surgery.
Medications that may be given to cats with stomach pain include:
Pain medications like
buprenorphine
or fentanyl
Antibiotics like cefazolin,
enrofloxacin
, and
metronidazole
Anti-nausea medications like
maropitant (Cerenia®)
Medications that protect the stomach through stomach acid control like
famotidine
or pantoprazole
In severe cases, such as if your cat has sepsis, your pet may need additional medications to support vital functions, such as medications to combat low blood pressure
Supportive care may include:
Fluids, usually given in a vein via catheter
Supplemental oxygen in an oxygen cage, if needed
A urinary catheter in cats who are experiencing urinary blockage
A feeding tube, if needed
Recovery and Management of Stomach Pain in Cats
If your
cat had surgery for stomach pain
, you will need to monitor their incision for at least two weeks after the operation. You will also likely go home with
pain medications for your cat
. Depending on the cause of the cat’s stomach pain, you may also have antibiotics to administer.
If your cat is licking or scratching at their incision, consider placing a
recovery cone or recovery suit
on them to protect their incision and to keep them from scratching or biting their stitches.
For critical cases, your pet may need to spend several days recovering in the hospital before coming home. If stomach pain was caused by a chronic health condition
like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
or hepatitis, your veterinarian will explain any long-term management they recommend, such as a dietary change, fiber supplementation, or liver protectant supplements.
Food Diet for Cats with Stomach Pain
If your cat experienced a urinary blockage, one of the most common therapies is to change your cat to a prescription urinary diet such as
Hill®'s Prescription Diet c/d Multicare Urinary Care
or
Royal Canin® Veterinary Diet Adult Urinary SO
. This will usually be a lifelong dietary change.
Be sure to finish any medications prescribed by your veterinarian and to follow all directions to ensure your cat has an easy and pain-free recovery.
FAQs
How can you tell if your cat is in pain internally?
Cats are known to be stoic, so it can be hard to tell if your cat is in pain internally. A cat with a tense abdomen who is yowling or responding aggressively to having their belly touched is likely in pain.
Why does my cat meow when I touch their stomach?
If your cat is otherwise acting normal, it’s likely they just don’t like having their stomach touched. However, if your cat’s abdomen is tense or distended, is vomiting, is having diarrhea, or has no interest in food, they may have a painful abdomen and need veterinary attention.
My cat yelps when I touch their stomach. What should I do?
Yowling when the stomach is touched is a sign of pain. If your cat is acting abnormally, contact your veterinarian as soon as possible.
