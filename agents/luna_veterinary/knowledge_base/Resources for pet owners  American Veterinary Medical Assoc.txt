Keeping animals healthy requires teamwork. As an owner, you're an important part of that team. When you know something is wrong with your animal, you rely on your veterinarian to help, and your veterinarian in turn works as part of a larger team of veterinary professionals.
Being a well-informed participant in your pet's care means educating yourself, understanding the importance of preventive care, and knowing when to consult your veterinarian and how to work with the veterinary team. It also means understanding the full range of questions your veterinarian can help with - not just caring for sick and injured animals, but advising you on nutrition, behavior, your pet's weight and exercise, and much more.
Your veterinarian
