Ahna Brutlag and Sherry Ripple (Welch) have been elected as ABVT’s President-Elect and Treasurer for the years 2020-2022. Dr. Brutlag will assume the President role in August of 2022. Board-certified internal medicine specialists (DACVIM) Board-certified emergency critical care specialists (DACVECC) Certified veterinary technicians (including American Veterinary Emergency Critical Care Technicians – AVECCT) Veterinarians (DVM) Clinical pharmacists/Doctors of Pharmacy(PharmD) All of our medical professionals have received extensive education in the area of veterinary toxicology prior to managing cases. Clinical pharmacists and board-certified veterinarians in internal medicine, emergency and critical care, and toxicology are available around the clock, as are herpetologists. Due to the extraordinary volume of serious pet poisoning cases involving human pharmaceuticals, clinical pharmacists are a critical member of our professional team. This multi-disciplinary approach to case management allows us to offer the highest level of assistance to you and your pet or patient. Pet Poison Helpline® also has a formal affiliation with the University of Minnesota’s College of Veterinary Medicine and College of Pharmacy. At the veterinary school, PPH maintains adjunct faculty positions where we participate in both the veterinary toxicology course as well as various population medicine courses. Pet Poison Helpline® has over 30 years of experience and expertise in the management of pets exposed to potentially dangerous substances. PPH is also partnered with the world’s largest industry poison control center to ensure pharmacovigilance and safety for both humans and pets, and serves multiple veterinary and human pharmaceutical companies and household good producers. Our core group of toxicologists founded the Minnesota Regional Poison Control Center over 25 years ago as faculty of the University of Minnesota. We’ve set the national standard as pioneers in industry toxicology. We handle over 100,000 cases a year for the large number of clients we serve. During the past three decades, our team has managed over 2.5 million cases involving potential poisonings.

On May 7, my miniature Dachshund, Kristi, ate some rat poison. I took her to our Emergency Animal Hospital, and was instructed to contact you immediately, which I did from one of their exam rooms. That night, and throughout the next few days, you consulted with the vets on call, offering life-saving advice (including a lipid IV drip) that enabled Kristi to pull through. One week later, Kristi was back at home and doing well. Now, almost one month later, she’s resumed all her normal activities and has received a great health report from our veterinarian. I will always be grateful for your help and advice. You offer a wonderful service! -Fran W. This last summer our almost 5 year old Black Lab, Megan, got herself into a little predicament while staying with her grandma 🙂 She is very mischievous and found herself an ant trap to munch on. This dog as a stomach of steel but we were still worried sick so we hopped in the car and got to her as fast as possible and then rushed her to the nearest vet. The vet was so kind and saw us ASAP without an appointment. She had us call the Pet Poison Helpline® (which we had never heard of) before she treated Megan so she knew what she was dealing with. Thank goodness they told us she would be just fine based upon her size and the small amount of poison she consumed. We were so relieved!!!!! Thank you so much for the help, we are forever grateful and make sure that if any of our 3 dogs are staying with someone they have the number for the Pet Poison Hotline! It was money well spent!!!! -Jessica S. Pet Poison Helpline® is my go-to resource for poison control and toxicology information. I am always impressed by the rapid response and depth of toxicological knowledge shared by Drs. Brutlag and Lee. The team at Pet Poison Helpline® are professional, courteous, and a superb resource for veterinary professionals and pet owners alike. -Janet Tobassen Crosby, DVM ( About.com Guide to Veterinary Medicine ) Thanks so much for your help! I called a week ago Sunday. My baby Belle Masakowski (5 yr old lab mix) ate a thermcare heating pad containing iron. I was in a complete panic and your professional helpful advice helped me get through the crisis. Belle had no side effects and is healthy and well. Thanks again from the bottom of my heart. . -Venus and Belle M. Thanks for saving my dog! We appreciate all that you do. I’ve enclosed a picture of my two girls, Velvet the daschund and Hazel the cockerspaniel. Hazel is the one that swallowed the blood pressure medicine. All better and back to her regular self. Thanks so much! -David H. We use Pet Poison Helpline® all the time!! -New York Veterinary Specialty and Emergency Center Communicating with Pet Poison Helpline® was absolutely seamless. I spoke with a kind, articulate, and very knowledgeable DVM, and received the information that I needed to help my patient. I’ll be using them again! -Dr. Indu M. Thank you so much for this service — I called last night after my dog ate a year’s supply of Heartguard+. With your guidance and information, I was able to help my dog without having to go to an emergency vet (2 hour drive away…) I’m happy to report that everything’s fine this morning, we’re back to wagging tails today! Thanks a million!!! -Margaret and Einstein T. The veterinarian I spoke with was very helpful, patient and understanding. Made me ALMOST calm about the situation. Most excellent service. -Chuck E. I wanted to thank your for your helpfullness and kindness when my cat, Carly, got sick. She is just about 100% recovered, and I know she couldn’t have survived without the advice you gave me. -Donna Thank you Pet Poison Helpline® for a wonderful externship! I learned so much and am impressed with the positive impact you have on the veterinary world -Jen G. We wanted to thank you so much for all of your help for our dog, Saffie. She accidentally ate our daughter’s ADHD medication and got extremely ill. The emergency vet said if it hadn’t been for you, our dog would probably have died from being given a sedative that was contra-indicated for that particular medicine. Your help was invaluable to them! Thank you again so much! Saffie is doing much better and her prognosis is good. -Julie P. Please accept my deepest appreciation and gratitude saving my Daphne’s life! She is so precious to us. Everyone loves her, such a joy to be around. I sing your praises! I will never forget your help! Thank you and God Bless you all. -Judith J. I used your services last week after my dog ate tile adhesive. The vet I spoke with was very helpful and was able to put my mind at ease. I’m happy to report the Stitch had no adverse effects from eating the adhesive and is doing great 🙂 Thanks for the awesome work you do!! -Ashley L. Thank you for helping my boy, Euri 🙂 I called you because he ate a peony petal, but he is fine now! -Becky A. Thank you! I have toddlers and pets! You will be a great help if they decide to feed the dogs something! -Melissa P. We really love to share your postings. How many thousands of pets get saved daily, weekly, yearly because of you all! We thank you!! -Romie Lane Pet Hospital Business Thanks for a fantastic service when I needed it. Service is professional, yet kind, courteous & understanding. -Jennifer B. The night before Valentines Day, we left our little Doxie mix rescue alone for a few hours. We came home to find that he had somehow got hold of an unopened box of chocolates and eaten every single one. I called the poison control number and they were very efficient and helped me tremendously. They analyzed the contents he had consumed. They instructed me to bring him to the emergency vet hospital in our area. He only weighs 14 lbs and what he had eaten could have been deadly. He spent 2 nights in the ER and is now back to his perky little self. Thank you to the considerate staff who helped us through this very scary situation. -Sandra S. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! You are the best and have saved my beautiful Jasmine twice!!! We thank you!!!!!!! -Karen G. Pet Poison Helpline® helped me and my dog – I highly recommend it. -Kristen B. Thank you so much for helping me and my kitten Maybelline! 🙂 -Lacey D. It is with deep pleasure that I inform you that my dog Breanna Nicole has recovered after swallowing some blood pressure medication. Due to your staff’s quick thinking and knowledge, Breanna Nicole did not suffer at all! I am so thankful to you for your kindness and great work that you do for animals. -Betty D. You guys rock…and have most likely saved Manny the Monster, all 12.5 pounds of him. from severe issues not to mention my peace of mind. -G. Paris P. Last night I posted a photo of a plant that my cat got into. Both Google image search and crowd sourcing confirmed it was a Dieffenbachia. They’re harmful to the cat that ate it, so I called Pet Poison Helpline® and they helped me by giving me step by step instructions on what to do to prevent her from getting more sick, exactly what to look out for, and when to bring her to the vet if necessary. Gracie is fine now, super happy about the milk and canned food they recommended. It was the best money I could’ve spent to make sure my 11 year old cat was going to be ok after hitting the poison kitty salad bar. -Betsy S. I just wanted to send a little note to say thank you for your assistance today with my dog, Addie. I did not know there was such a thing as a poison control for pets. I discovered you purely by accident thanks to the National Poison Control Center. I will share your contact info with all of my pet owner friends. Again thank you very much. -Eunice T. My cat swallowed my blood pressure medication this morning. Oh no! I called my vet immediately and they told me to call you with the details, which I did. I just want to thank you for your excellent service. It’s good to know that you exist. I will be giving all my friends with pets your phone number to put on their refrigerator. Thanks again for being there. -Jill W. Last night I was in a panic! one of the biggest loves of my life, my little Frenchie Noir, ingested paintballs. Melanie saved my sanity! AND my pocketbook as well. She guided me through this scary time with knowledge and a special calmness that will not be forgotten anytime soon. Noir is fine and doing well today. I cannot thank you enough. You are amazing and being able to talk to someone who answered ALL my questions and my concerns in my time of need was WELL WORTH the money for peace of mind. Thank you, thank you! -Molly C. Arty swallowed one of my pills: I did everything you advised me to do and watched him all day (also calling you several times to check if he was OK). He is fine now and back to his old self!!! Thanks so much for having this site for us to call and manning it 24 hours. -Barbara G.

Our human medical experts include physicians with board certification in Emergency Medicine, Preventive Medicine (Occupational and Environmental Medicine), Addiction Medicine and Medical Toxicology, as well as pharmacists (PharmDs, including many who have completed residencies and fellowships in Clinical Toxicology), nurses, pharmacy technicians, paramedics, and emergency medical technicians, several of whom are Certified Specialists in Poison Information (CSPI).

Partners and staff also have faculty appointments at the University of Minnesota’s College of Veterinary Medicine, where they team-teach Veterinary Toxicology as part of the core curriculum and participate in population medicine courses. To foster experiential training and student mentorship outside the classroom, we also offer formal clerkships and clinical rotations to veterinary and pharmacy students.

Driven by our desire to educate, we also provide complimentary scientific webinars on veterinary toxicology, adverse event management, and product safety, that are attended by thousands of professionals each year and archived in our online library. To keep veterinary practitioners informed on emerging trends in toxicology, we publish quarterly newsletters with materials valuable to them, their staff, and their clients. We also maintain an online, publicly available ‘poison directory’ detailing more than 300 individual toxicants and providing information on species risks, expected severity of poisoning, clinical signs, photos, and more.

We also encourage employees to be active in these associations as it helps them grow and develop into creative thought leaders committed to acting and delivering on their responsibilities. Over the past decade, we are grateful and humbled by the accolades and awards received in recognition of our contributions. However, none are more meaningful than repeatedly being named a Top Workplace in Minnesota. This award, organized in partnership with the Minneapolis/St Paul Star Tribune newspaper, is based upon feedback from an employee survey regarding company leadership, culture, communications, career opportunities, workplace environment, managerial skills, pay and benefits. Over 2,000 organizations were invited to participate in the survey, and over 140,000 employees shared their views. Other notable recognitions include the Herbal Industry Leader Award (2021) from the American Herbal Products Association which recognizes companies or organizations that work to move the industry forward by exceeding the standards of normal business practices; along with individual recognitions from the Household and Commercial Products Association including the Chairman’s Award (2013) and volunteer recognition awards (Pest Management Division, 2018; Air Care Division, 2019). Collectively, our mission is a simple one: to make the world a safer place for people and animals. We have worked toward that mission for over 35 years and, through thoughtful planning, cultivation of new leaders, experts, and educators, have set the stage to continue on for the next 35 years. What does this service provide for me & my pet? Pet Poison Helpline® is a 24/7 animal poison control service available for pet owners and veterinarians who need assistance with a potentially poisoned pet. By calling or chatting with us, you will be connected with one of our highly trained and credentialed veterinary specialists who will make an assessment as to the risk of harm to the pet, provide initial recommendations for treatment that can be provided at home, and, when necessary, direct you to your veterinarian for further evaluation and treatment. We will then provide the veterinarian with the necessary treatment advice to assist them in delivering the appropriate care for the pet. This is all included in our per incident fee of $89. Is there a fee for this service? Yes. There is a one-time consultation fee of $89 per incident. This fee covers not only the initial consultation, but also any follow-up consultations made with the pet owner and/or veterinarian. Why do you charge for this service? Our sole purpose is to ensure that pets stay healthy. Our single goal is to prevent their injury or illness from potential poisonings. To accomplish this, we operate a 24-hour pet poison control center which requires considerable effort, resources, and expense. Unlike public poison control centers in the human sector, veterinary poison control is allotted no tax dollars to support their existence. Pet Poison Helpline® does not receive any state, federal, or other public funding. If we did not charge, we could not exist. How do you charge for this service? There is a $89 consultation fee payable by credit card either by calling us or through the payment processing form if you are using chat. This fee is valid for the duration of the case and includes all follow-up consultations. What if my pet's treatment requires additional contacts to you? Once the initial consultation is paid, there will be no further costs regarding the case. You will not be charged again for follow-up guidance. What if my chat disconnects? Simply call or chat us back referencing your existing case number and we’ll be able to pick back up where we left off. What is the procedure if my pet needs immediate veterinary treatment? We provide you with a case number. You simply relay the case number, along with our phone number, to your veterinarian. Your veterinarian can then call us and receive treatment advice throughout the entire course of treatment for no additional fee. We are not able to assist veterinary professionals over chat. Why would my veterinarian need your assistance? Poison control and toxicology is a specialty. Also, poisoning incidents are not frequently encountered by the veterinarian and when they are, each incident usually involves different substances and circumstances. Therefore, most veterinarians appreciate a resource for obtaining vital information for poisoning emergencies. Is there any animal or toxic ingestion with which you cannot assist us? No. We have the staff and the expertise to confidently deal with any type of exposure with any species of animal. Who staffs this service? Pet Poison Helpline® is staffed by trained veterinary health experts, including veterinarians, licensed veterinary technicians, clinical toxicologists, board-certified veterinary toxicologists, board-certified internal medicine and emergency critical care specialists, pharmacologists, and other health care professionals. All of our medical staff members have received extensive training in the area of veterinary toxicology. We keep abreast of new research and information in the field of toxicology to ensure that every caller receives the most accurate treatment advice possible for the care of the pet.
