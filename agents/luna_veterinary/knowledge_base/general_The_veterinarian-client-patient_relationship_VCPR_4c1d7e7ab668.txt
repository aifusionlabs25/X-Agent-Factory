==================================================

The veterinarian-client-patient relationship (VCPR) Animals enrich our lives in countless ways, and we want to keep them as happy and healthy as possible. The veterinarian-client-patient relationship, or VCPR for short, helps us do that by enabling your veterinarian to provide the best possible recommendations and medical care based on your and your animal’s needs. What is a veterinarian-client-patient relationship (VCPR)? A VCPR is the professional relationship between you, your animal(s), and your veterinarian. It exists when your veterinarian knows your animal well enough—typically through a recent physical examination or regular visits—to make informed decisions about the animal’s health. This relationship is the foundation of safe, effective veterinary care. It must be in place before your veterinarian can diagnose a condition, prescribe medication, or treat your animal. A VCPR means: You have chosen a veterinarian to care for your animal. That veterinarian has seen your animal recently enough (typically through a hands-on examination) to understand their health needs. You agree to follow your veterinarian’s instructions, and they agree to take responsibility for your animal’s care. Your role in the VCPR includes: Entrusting your veterinarian with responsibility for making clinical judgments about your animal's health Asking questions to make sure you fully understand any diagnosis, treatment, and care plan Following your veterinarian's instructions Your veterinarian's role involves: Making clinical judgments based on direct knowledge of your animal’s condition Accepting responsibility for providing your animal with medical care Keeping a complete, up-to-date record of your animal's medical care Advising you about the benefits and risks of different treatment options Monitoring your animal’s progress and adjusting treatment as needed to help your animal improve Providing guidance on how to access emergency or urgent care for your animal if needed How is a VCPR established and maintained? A VCPR can only be established when your veterinarian examines your animal in person or makes medically appropriate and timely visits to the operation where animals are kept (for example, farm animals)—except in a few states where the relationship can be established electronically, such as through telemedicine. It is maintained by regular veterinary visits as needed to monitor your animal's health. In states where the VCPR is allowed to be established electronically, an in-person examination or timely visits to your operation will still be required for the use of certain medications or for certain other activities, like issuing a health certificate or veterinary feed directive (for food-producing animals). If a VCPR is established but your veterinarian does not regularly see your animal or visit your operation afterward, the VCPR is no longer valid, and it would be unethical—and potentially illegal—for your veterinarian to dispense or prescribe medications or recommend treatment. Once a VCPR is established, it may be possible to maintain the relationship through consultations by email, telephone, or online platforms, in between medically necessary, hands-on exams or visits. Your veterinarian will use their professional judgment to determine whether this would be in your animal’s best interests. add Why is the VCPR so important? The VCPR supports the needs of animals, animal owners, and veterinarians alike. It fosters trust and communication, empowering you to make informed decisions and support your animal’s long-term health. What’s more, when your veterinarian knows your animal’s health history and current condition—usually through regular, in-person exams or visits, they can more accurately diagnose issues, make sound medical judgments, and provide care and recommendations tailored to your animal’s individual needs. There also are legal aspects. Most states require that a VCPR be in place for your veterinarian to diagnose or treat your animal, or prescribe or dispense medications. In addition, federal law requires that a VCPR exist before a veterinarian can prescribe certain medications or issue health certificates or veterinary feed directives. In those cases, the VCPR must have been established in person, whether through a hands-on physical examination or medically appropriate and timely visits to the operation where the animal is kept—with no exceptions. add Why is a hands-on physical examination so important? Unlike people, animals can’t tell us what’s wrong, and figuring this out is like solving a very complex puzzle. A comprehensive, hands-on physical examination and other diagnostic tests allow your veterinarian to gather all the puzzle pieces and fit them together to see the full picture. With that picture, your veterinarian is better able to accurately determine your animal’s health status and recommend the best treatment. This can't be achieved through a telephone, email, or online conversation. Without a hands-on examination, there’s a greater risk of misdiagnosis, inappropriate or ineffective treatment, and other potentially harmful outcomes. add When does a VCPR end? Your VCPR will automatically end if you allow the regular veterinary visits recommended by your veterinarian to lapse. (Some states dictate by law a maximum interval between in-person examinations.) You, as the client, also can intentionally terminate your VCPR at any time by notifying your veterinarian. If your veterinarian chooses to end your VCPR, they should notify you and, if your animal has an immediate, life-threatening illness, provide medical care until you have transitioned to another veterinarian. add
