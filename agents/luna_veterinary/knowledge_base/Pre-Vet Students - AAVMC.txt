Advisor Resources
AAVMC recognizes advisors’ role in supporting, motivating, nurturing, and guiding health professions applicants through the preparation and application process. We want to provide advisors with tools and resources to help them advise students to be well-prepared and successful veterinary school applicants. The veterinary workforce must reflect a diverse society, and advisors are in a pivotal role to help encourage and support students from underrepresented and minority populations apply to veterinary school.
