The fall season ushers in not just a change of leaves and temperature but also a handful of potential toxins to dogs, cats, and even horses.
How easily your pet can be exposed to these toxins depends on how much access they have to them.
It’s important to know what potential fall toxins lurk in your home, yard, or garage so that you can keep all pets safe during the fall season.
Key Takeaways
Many common household and yard items can be toxic to pets particularly during the fall season, including rodenticides, antifreeze, and certain mushrooms.
Symptoms of toxin ingestion vary by toxin but commonly include vomiting, lethargy, and seizures.Red maple leaves are highly toxic to horses, especially when wilted or dried.

Immediate veterinary attention is crucial. Call your vet or Pet Poison Helpline if you suspect exposure.
Most Common Fall Toxins Poisonous to Pets
While plenty of everyday items pose a risk to both
cats
and
dogs
year-round, during the fall season it’s important to check your home, garage, and even outdoor space for the following toxins:
Rodenticides
Rodenticides, also known as mouse, rat, or mole bait, are commonly found in garages, yards, houses, and even barns. Rodenticides are available in hard or soft blocks, pellets, worms, or liquids.
The drugs that rodenticides contain (anticoagulants, bromethalin, cholecalciferol, and phosphides) are toxic to
dogs
,
cats
, and
horses
. And because these baits are flavored to attract rodents, they also easily attract our pets.
It’s important to place these pest control products in
plastic bait stations
, which help decrease the risk of exposure to nosy dogs or cats. Leaving rodenticides out in the open increases the risk of accidental ingestion.
The type of rodenticide ingested will determine the signs of toxicity in a pet. Depending on the type of rodenticide, ingested symptoms may include:
Unexpected bleeding into the abdomen, chest cavity, and/or other areas
An increase in drinking and urination
Lack of appetite
Lethargy
Body tremors
Seizures
Coma
Because of the differences in rodenticides, it’s best to contact Pet Poison Helpline or your veterinarian to determine next steps.
Mothballs
Mothballs protect our clothing from pesky moths when our garments are stored in containers. They are commonly used in storage bins that hold clothes in closets and garages. There are two main types of mothballs: those with paradichlorobenzene and those with naphthalene.
Depending on the ingredients, mothballs can affect the central nervous system and damage red blood cells, liver and kidneys.
Pets who ingest mothballs containing paradichlorobenzene may develop signs of toxicity within 24 hours after ingestion, including:
Abdominal pain
when touched
Vomiting
Lethargy
Tremors
Ataxia
(wobbly when walking)
If emergency vet care is received early, prognosis is generally good. However, if treatment is not started right away, death is possible.
If your dog or cat ingests a mothball containing naphthalene, symptoms can develop within a few hours or be delayed up to seven days. These signs may include:
Vomiting
Lethargy
Seizures
Difficulty breathing
Pale gums
Increase in drinking and urination, lack of appetite, yellow discoloration to the skin, or vomiting and lethargy, which may be signs of kidney and/or liver issues
Prognosis is generally good with early intervention, but ingesting mothballs containing naphthalene can be fatal if treatment is delayed.
Mushrooms
While mushrooms can grow year-round, fall is a popular time to see them sprouting in yards. Different types of mushrooms are
toxic to both dogs
and cats, so it’s important when seeking medical care to try to determine what mushroom your pet ingested.
The type of mushroom will also determine what symptoms your pet will experience, so it’s best to contact the Pet Poison Helpline and/or your vet to determine next steps.
Mushroom poisoning in dogs and cats is considered a medical emergency, so seek emergency vet help if you believe your dog or cat ingested any type of mushroom.
Antifreeze (Ethylene Glycol)
Antifreeze refers to a liquid that’s added to an engine’s cooling system—typically by mixing it with water—to prevent freezing at low temperatures.
Antifreeze is generally found in automobiles, in a garage or in driveway puddles. Active ingredients include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or other alcohols. Ethylene glycol is highly toxic and is lethal when ingested by a
cat
or
dog
.
Within a few hours of ingesting antifreeze, dogs and cats will develop vomiting, increased thirst and urination, ataxia, and seizures.
If you think your cat or dog ingested any form of antifreeze, contact your vet immediately to determine next steps.
Compost Piles
Compost piles may contain toxic foods or plants, depending on what is composted.
When certain products—including dairy foods and decaying organic material—are composted, mold may grow, and toxins called
tremorgenic mycotoxins
can be produced from these molds.
Symptoms of tremorgenic mycotoxin poisoning usually appear within one hour after ingestion but can be delayed for up to three or four hours. Signs may include ataxia, tremors, or seizures. If treated quickly, prognosis is generally good.
Maple Leaves
If you own a horse, be mindful of red maple leaves if they are present in your area, as horses can become ill with
maple leaf poisoning.
A toxin is contained in wilted and dried red maple leaves and causes red blood cell destruction if ingested by a horse, leading to
anemia
.
Clinical signs include reddish-brown urine, pale yellowish or dark brown gums, difficulty breathing, and weakness. Emergency vet care is crucial, as the condition can be fatal without treatment.
Prognosis is good if a horse is treated before signs begin, but after clinical signs appear the prognosis is guarded even with aggressive treatment.
Signs of Toxin Poisoning in Pets
If your pet ingests a toxin, symptoms will vary depending on the type of toxin. General signs of poisoning in any animal can include:
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Bleeding/bruising (from either the mouth or rectum)
Pale gums
Weakness
Agitation
Lethargy
Abnormal heart rate or respiratory rate
Tremors
What To Do if Your Pet Ingests a Toxin
If your pet is exposed to any toxin, immediately call your veterinarian or the
Pet Poison Helpline
at 855-764-7661 to determine next steps.
It’s important to gather as much information as possible about the toxin and how much exposure your pet may have had to it. If you can, locate any packaging, receipt, photos, or pieces of the toxin when discussing it with the Pet Poison Helpline or your vet.
It’s OK if you don’t have any of this information available though. Getting your pet immediate help is the most important step when a toxin is ingested.
Keeping Your Pet Safe From Fall Toxins
By recognizing common toxins during the fall season, you can increase your vigilance in limiting or eliminating them from your pet’s environment.
Ideally, rodenticides should be in kept in bait stations and not placed freely in the environment or buried, as our pets can smell the attractants and dig them up.
While bait stations help to limit access, some dogs are crafty and will still gain access to the station’s contents—always monitor your pet outside if they typically get into these types of things.
Supervising your pet and and keeping them on a
leash
during walks can also help prevent them from ingesting potential toxins.
Mothballs and antifreeze should always be stored away from pets. When emptying or disposing of antifreeze, place it in a container with a lid and out of your pets’ access. Clean up spilled antifreeze as soon as possible.
Mushrooms should be removed and compost should be kept separate from your pet’s area. If your dog has access to the compost zone, use fencing or close supervision to prevent contact with any toxins. You can also keep your pup safe in an
outdoor play pen
when supervising them outdoors.
During the fall season, it’s important to stay aware of any toxins in your house or outdoors. By taking a few simple precautions, you can help keep your pet safe from seasonal hazards and together enjoy everything fall has to offer.
