FAQs About Dog Vomiting One minute, your dog is happily wagging their tail—next thing you know, they’re doing the dreaded hunch-and-heave. Dog vomiting is never a fun surprise, but it’s something every pet parent deals with at some point. Whether it’s due to scarfing down food too fast, an upset tummy or something more serious, knowing what’s normal (and what’s not) can make all the difference. Here’s everything you need to know about why dogs throw up, when to worry (and call a vet!), and how to help your pup feel better. Why Is My Dog Throwing Up? So, it’s obvious your dog is throwing up, but why do dogs vomit? The causes run the gamut from a simple upset stomach to a bowel obstruction . 9 Possible Causes of Dog Vomiting Here are some of the most common reasons a dog vomits, according to Nina Griffin, DVM, medical director at the Veterinary Emergency Group in Lynnwood, Washington. Dietary indiscretion: Dogs will often vomit after eating something they shouldn’t , like garbage or foreign objects. Infections: Just like with humans, viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections can make your dog sick, causing vomiting. Toxins: Many household toxins , like chemicals in cleaning supplies , medications, toxic plants, or certain foods (like chocolate ), can make your dog sick. Gastritis: Gastritis is inflammation of the stomach lining, which can be triggered by many things, like eating something they shouldn’t or a foreign object. Motion sickness: Also like humans, dogs can get motion sickness . If your dog vomits after car rides, motion sickness is the likely culprit. Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis , or inflammation of the pancreas, can also trigger vomiting. This can be caused by diet (especially fatty foods), obesity , trauma, or genetic predisposition. Organ diseases: Advanced liver disease , kidney disease, or adrenal gland disease can also make your dog nauseous. Intestinal obstructions: If your dog’s digestive tract is partially or completely blocked by a foreign object, it can cause vomiting and/or diarrhea . In this case, they’ll likely stop eating normally too. Allergies: Chronic vomiting can also be a sign of food allergies , according to Michaella Abugov, DVM, veterinarian at Muddy Creek Animal Care Center in Rowley, Massachusetts. In this case, vomiting may be accompanied by itchy paws , ear infections , skin infections , and/or diarrhea. Dog Vomit Color Chart: 7 Types of Dog Vomit The color and consistency of your dog’s vomit can also give you clues about what’s going on and what you should do. Vomit Color or Appearance What It Could Mean What You Should Do Clear or foamy A dog vomiting white foam could indicate an empty stomach or mild gastritis. Monitor your dog. If it happens frequently, contact your vet. Yellow or bile-stained A dog vomiting yellow liquid may mean they have an empty stomach; bile from the liver gets mixed in with stomach contents. Feed your dog and monitor to see if it resolves. Brown Your dog may have ingested dirt or stool. It could also indicate the presence of digested blood. If it happens more than once, call your vet. Red or bloody This is often a sign of bleeding in the stomach or esophagus. A dog vomiting blood is cause for concern; call your vet immediately. Dark brown or black material that looks like coffee grounds This indicates digested blood, which could point to serious issues like gastric or bleeding ulcers. This is cause for concern; call your vet immediately. Chunky, with obvious food pieces A dog vomiting undigested food might have eaten too fast or may have an upset stomach from their most recent meal. Monitor your dog; if it happens two or more times in a 24-hour period, call your vet. Spaghetti- or rice-like pieces This may be a sign of worms in dog vomit, which points to a heavy intestinal worm infestation. Take your dog to the vet to get dewormed . When Should I Be Worried About My Dog’s Vomiting? Occasional vomiting is par for the course, but there are some signs that something isn’t quite right. Dr. Griffin says you should seek immediate veterinary care if your dog: Vomits blood (red or black, coffee ground vomit) Vomits continuously or repeatedly, especially if they can’t keep any food or water down Shows signs of lethargy or weakness, or your dog collapses Has a bloated abdomen or is excessively drooling (which could indicate bloat , a life-threatening, quickly progressive condition) Is uncomfortable (they may let you know by whining, guarding their stomach, licking objects, eating grass, and/or acting restless) Displays neurological signs, like seizures , staggering , or confusion How Do Vets Determine Why a Dog Is Throwing Up? Diagnosis always starts with a physical examination and medical history, according to Dr. Griffin. You can help your vet with this process by gathering the following information before visiting the clinic: Monitor the frequency of vomiting. Is it just one or two episodes, or is it ongoing? How often? Look for any potential toxins or hazards. Did your dog eat something they shouldn’t have, such as a plant, chemical, or human food (chocolate, grapes , etc.)? Check for any changes in diet or routine. A sudden diet change or stress could contribute. Think about any new treats or table scraps you’ve given them too. Look at the vomit. Try to note the color, appearance, and any other unusual features, like foreign objects or food content. Track any other symptoms. Pay attention to if your dog is lethargic, has diarrhea, or seems to be uncomfortable. Consider recent travel or activity. Note any new environments, including walks in unfamiliar areas, that could have led to the ingestion of harmful items. After your vet gets a good history and physical examination they might recommend more tests, like blood tests , urine tests , fecal analysis, X-rays , and/or an ultrasound . If your vet can’t get an answer from these tests, exploratory surgery or endoscopy may be needed. How Can I Help My Vomiting Dog at Home? If your dog vomits once and is acting otherwise normal, you mostly likely don’t need to do anything aside from monitoring them to make sure it resolves. However, if vomiting continues, there are several things you can do at home to help them while you await veterinary care, including: Fasting: Dr. Griffin recommends withholding food for 12–24 hours (but still giving them water). This gives the stomach a chance to rest and recover. Hydration: Vomiting can lead to dehydration, so give your dog water or ice cubes to keep them hydrated. A dog water fountain, like the Petlibro Capsule Ultra Quiet Dog Water Fountain , can help entice pickier pups to drink. Bland diet: If the vomiting goes away with a fasting period, you may consider offering a bland diet, like boiled chicken and rice , in small amounts to see if they can tolerate it. This is a good way to give them some nutrition while their stomach settles. Comfort: Comfort goes a long way. To help minimize stress, keep them in a calm, quiet environment and ensure they have a cozy spot to rest. Do not give your dog over-the-counter anti-nausea medicines unless your vet recommends it. Some of these medications can be harmful to dogs.

Why is my dog shaking and vomiting? Shaking and vomiting together can be a sign of pain or distress, nausea, stomach upset, toxin ingestion , neurological issues, fever , or severe dehydration, according to Dr. Griffin. How do I clean dog vomit from the carpet? To clean dog vomit from the carpet, first, pick up as much as you can, then blot the area to absorb excess liquid.
