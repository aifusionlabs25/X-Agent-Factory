She graduated from Colorado State University (Go Rams!) with a bachelor’s degree in Biology and a minor in Neuroanatomy/Biomedical Sciences. She went on to earn her Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona, CA, in 2011. After graduation, Dr. V was accepted into a competitive, AVMA-approved small animal emergency and surgical rotating internship at Pet Emergency and Specialty Hospital in Thousand Oaks, CA.

She returned to New Mexico, where she served families and their pets for over eight years, before making her way back to Southern California to provide compassionate and practical care for pets of all kinds. Her special interests include emergency surgery, critical care, endocrine emergencies, wound care, pain management, diagnostic ultrasounds, and mentoring fellow veterinarians. Dr. Villanueva has a special place in her heart for senior and geriatric pets and values the human-animal bond, no matter the species. Dr. Villanueva enjoys spending time with her husband Anthony, their daughters and son, and four-legged babies: Kiki (a French Bulldog), Clementine (a Pug), and Torkoal (a Desert Tortoise).

May 2, 2025 Sandy O On Easter Sunday, we took our dwarf rabbit there after getting a diagnosis I didn't agree with at another emergency vet. From the minute I called, I knew we were in the right place. They took care of her immediately and let us be with her the whole time. I was so happy to have people who were so kind hearted and loving, taking care of my baby. We were given options on treatment and not pressured or guilted into the choice to make. We made the best choice going there and we were able to take care of her at home with prescribed medications. I am happy to say she made a full recovery and is doing well nearly 2 weeks later. We appreciate you all! May 1, 2025 Karina Otaduy I'm thrilled to share my incredible experience, which has left me feeling inspired and grateful. As I begin this review, my heart is overflowing with emotion, but I'll do my best to convey the exceptional care my beloved labradoodle received. After a bath, my seven-year-old neutered labradoodle experienced a concerning issue - his penis was exposed and didn't retract after an hour. I was panic-stricken, knowing that delayed treatment could lead to infection. Thankfully, I contacted VEG, and the compassionate Holly calmed my nerves. My two dogs are my everything - my world, my peace, my sanity. I'm so relieved that I found a hospital that truly cares. The Veterinary Emergency Hospital is a beacon of hope, where transparency and kindness reign supreme. The similarity to a human emergency room is striking, allowing pet owners to witness the care their pets receive. Dr. Yeng's compassion, knowledge, and genuine concern for my pet's well-being left me in awe. Nurse Bri's patience and gentle touch while taking my dog's vitals were impressive, especially given my dog's nervous state. I've had the pleasure of knowing Dr. Villanueva from a previous facility, and her exceptional care and love for animals continue to inspire me. Miraculously, my dog's issue resolved itself within an hour of our arrival, and the hospital didn't charge me a single penny. This remarkable experience has shown me that VEG truly prioritizes animal care over profits. Although this location is not close to my home, I'll never hesitate to return, knowing that my pets will receive the best care possible. I'm deeply grateful for this experience and hope that others will find comfort in knowing that VEG is a shining example of compassion and kindness in animal care. April 8, 2025 Ylyza Ang My dog, Kevyn, ate something she was not supposed to and the moment we walked in - the staff at VEG were incredibly patient and compassionate. Loved that I got to be right by my dog the whole time. They send a link that breaks down the cost, answered all our questions, and their care was top notch. I understand why people drive so far to take their animals here. Thankfully we just live down the street and I'm so grateful for the nurses and Dr Kevin Yang who handled our dog so well!
