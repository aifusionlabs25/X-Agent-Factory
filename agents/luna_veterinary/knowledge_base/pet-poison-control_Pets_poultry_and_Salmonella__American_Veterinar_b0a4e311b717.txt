Pets, poultry, and Salmonella Reptiles (like lizards, snakes, turtles, and tortoises), amphibians (like frogs, toads, newts, and salamanders), and hedgehogs can make fun and fascinating pets—but they also can carry a hidden health risk: Salmonella . The same is true of birds commonly kept in backyard flocks, like chickens and ducks (including chicks and ducklings) and other poultry. While these animals can carry Salmonella in their digestive tracts without getting sick, this isn't the case for people. Certain strains of Salmonella can cause severe illness in people—especially young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. These risks can be minimized with some simple preventive measures. What is salmonellosis? Salmonellosis is an illness caused by Salmonella bacteria. It commonly causes diarrhea (sometimes bloody), stomach cramps, and fever. Other symptoms can include headache, nausea, and vomiting. Most people recover within four to seven days without medical treatment, but some may become seriously ill and require hospitalization. In severe cases, the bacteria may be absorbed from the intestines into the bloodstream and other parts of the body, which can be life-threatening. Small turtles (shells less than four inches long), bearded dragons, and African dwarf frogs are a few examples of reptiles and amphibians tied to human outbreaks of salmonellosis. Small turtles, in particular, have been a significant source of illness in children—not because they are more likely to carry Salmonella but because their small size makes them more likely for toddlers and infants to put them in their mouths. Due to the risk these animals pose, the sale of turtles under four inches has been banned in the U.S. since 1975; however, illegal sales continue to occur. Human cases also have been traced to hedgehogs and backyard poultry (especially chicks and ducklings). Learn more about outbreaks of salmonellosis tied to animal exposure . How is Salmonella transmitted? Animals carrying Salmonella can shed the bacteria in their feces (poop). People may become infected by accidentally swallowing the bacteria—which can happen more easily than you might think. Examples include: Lax hand hygiene : Forgetting to wash your hands after touching or handling the animals, their food, water sources, habitats (like cages, coops, tanks, or terrariums), bedding, or anything else that may be contaminated with their feces. Close physical contact : Kissing, snuggling, nuzzling, or—in the case of young children—mouthing the animals Unsafe handling practices : Cleaning habitats or food/water containers in kitchen sinks or bathtubs without properly disinfecting surfaces afterward Space sharing : Letting the animals roam freely indoors, especially in areas where food or drinks are prepared or consumed or in households with high-risk individuals Although any reptile, amphibian, hedgehog, or poultry has the potential to shed Salmonella , this doesn't mean you need to part with these animals. In fact, it's quite possible to safely enjoy them. All it takes is a commitment to practicing some simple precautions. How is salmonellosis prevented? Testing and treating reptiles, amphibians, hedgehogs, or poultry for Salmonella generally is not recommended. Rather, it's best to assume they are carrying the bacteria and to take steps to protect yourself and others, such as: Don't buy or adopt turtles with shell lengths less than four inches, especially if you have young children. Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after touching or handling any reptile, amphibian, hedgehog, or poultry; their habitats; or anything (including food) they or their feces may have contacted. Closely supervise children—particularly those younger than five years—when interacting with these animals, and assist young children with hand washing. Prevent these animals from freely roaming in your house. Avoid housing these animals in children's bedrooms, especially if the children are younger than five years. Keep these animals out of food and drink preparation or consumption areas. When cleaning animal habitats and supplies like feeders, water containers, or other equipment: Wear gloves. If possible, do the cleaning outside the home, and stay away from areas where fruit or vegetables are grown or near sources of drinking water like wells. If outdoor cleaning isn't possible, use a laundry sink or bathtub indoors, and be sure to clean and disinfect these surfaces before others use them. After cleaning the habitat, remove and discard the gloves, then thoroughly wash your hands. Contact your physician if you or other household members develop diarrhea, stomach cramps, fever, or other signs of gastrointestinal illness. Be sure to mention which types of animals you have, as this can help with the diagnosis. It is important that individuals at high risk of salmonellosis take extra precautions and, whenever possible, refrain from activities that might increase their risk, such as cleaning animal habitats. Reptiles, amphibians, hedgehogs, and poultry are not recommended for childcare centers, nursing homes, palliative care facilities, or other places where at-risk people receive care.

Just like people food, they sometimes may be contaminated with bacteria like Salmonella or Listeria , which can cause serious illness in animals and people. Learn more
