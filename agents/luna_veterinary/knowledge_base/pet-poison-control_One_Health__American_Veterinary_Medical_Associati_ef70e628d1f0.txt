One Health In this article: Learn about the concept of One Health and the connections among animal, human, and environmental health. Discover how the AVMA supports One Health. Find out why veterinarians play integral roles in the One Health movement. Help prevent spread of diseases Traveling internationally? Planning and precautions can reduce the risk of spreading animal and zoonotic diseases. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) PFAS are synthetic chemicals that don't easily break down in the environment and can build up in body tissues. Understand their sources, exposure routes, and potential hazards. Learn more One Health refers to two related ideas: First, it is the concept that humans, animals, and the world we live in are inextricably linked. Second, it refers to the collaborative effort of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment. The concept behind One Health has existed for centuries. But even today studies in the areas of human, animal, and environmental science are largely conducted independently, and obvious connections may be missed. As the human population continues to grow and our relationships with animals continue to evolve, understanding the interdependencies of people, animals, and the environment becomes even more critical to our collective health and safety. AVMA's commitment to One Health The AVMA strongly supports education and advancement in One Health, which is the integrative effort of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals, plants, and the ecosystems that support life. The AVMA will actively promote the One Health approach, and all roles that veterinarians play in advancing it, through outreach and advocacy at the national and international levels. Veterinarians work collaboratively with multiple disciplines and stakeholders to protect and advance One Health, supporting healthy, productive, and resilient communities and ecosystems. Specifically, the AVMA supports veterinarians in the advancement of One Health including but not limited to: Protecting and advancing the health and welfare of all animals Investigating animal and human disease outbreaks and developing and implementing programs to enhance epidemiologic understanding, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and eradication of such diseases Building global surveillance systems to enhance early detection of, and response to, disease threats Ensuring the wholesomeness and safety of all food of animal origin—from the farm to the fork Conducting research to advance animal health and welfare as well as human, public, and ecosystem health Evaluating the safety and efficacy of medicines, medical products, animal foods, and food additives. Building and rebuilding health infrastructures and helping communities around the world recover from manmade and natural disasters Protecting the environment through programs that manage animal agricultural waste, safe disposal of pharmaceuticals, and utilize environmentally conscious practices in the workplace Working with captive and free-ranging wildlife to protect biodiversity and advance species conservation efforts Advocating for and embracing innovation and technology Fostering a One Health approach within the next generation of veterinarians, other medical professionals, and other scientists AVMA has successfully led the One Health approach, in collaboration with the American Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, the One Health Commission, other veterinary associations, and many others. AVMA has been integral to the introduction of federal One Health legislation and AVMA will continue these and other efforts to advance One Health. add One Health facts and figures The goal of One Health is to address current and potential health and welfare issues through collaboration among all the health sciences—veterinary medicine, human medicine, environmental science, and public health. Consider these facts: According to the United Nations, the world’s population is projected to reach about 8.6 billion in 2030 and could grow to 10.2 billion by the year 2100.. The human-animal bond, the mutually beneficial relationship between people and animals, has existed for thousands of years and awareness of its positive impacts continues to grow. As our population continues to expand geographically, areas of overlap in human and wild animal habitat increase. This brings greater risk of exposure to new viruses, bacteria, and other disease-causing pathogens for animals and people. Three out of every four new or emerging infectious diseases in people are acquired from animals, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Human and animal health require that we vigilantly protect our food and water supplies from contamination stemming from biosecurity failures, natural disasters, terrorism, or other causes. add Veterinarians and One Health Veterinarians play an integral role in One Health because animals both impact and are impacted by people and the environment. Whether as clinical practitioners, epidemiologists, or ecological experts, veterinarians are essential to advancing One Health and protecting the health and safety of its three pillars— animals, people, and the environment. Animal health and welfare When it comes to protecting the health and welfare of animals, no one is more committed or better equipped to handle the task than veterinarians and our teams. We don’t just care for animals when they’re sick or injured. We provide preventive care and exams that keep them healthy, work with owners to make sure they get nutritious food, help manage their weight, provide guidance on behavior and training, offer advice on pet selection, and much more. Learn more Public health From issues like food safety and security, to diseases that can be transferred between people and animals, veterinarians have the unique knowledge and experience to address the many ways that animals impact people. Likewise, human and public health issues often affect animal health and welfare. For example, restrictions on sheltering animals with people during natural disasters can result in animal abandonment. Learn more Environmental health Veterinary expertise in toxicology, epidemiology, and ecology are vital to efforts to understand, control, prevent, diagnose, and treat environment-associated diseases that affect both people and animals. Waste disposal Wildlife management One Health Commission The One Health Commission, working together with numerous other groups around the world, seeks to advance the One Health movement through education and cross-disciplinary cooperation. The AVMA was a driving force in its creation.
