As a young adult, Jennifer was employed by several veterinary clinics and other pet-related businesses because (who knew?) you could actually get paid to work with animals! After graduating from college, she shifted her focus to the broader ideals of conservation and animal welfare through her work with the Animal Welfare Institute, Society for Animal Protective Legislation, and Wildlife Habitat Council before returning to her first love, veterinary medicine. In the years after veterinary school, Jennifer has been an associate veterinarian and chief of staff in several veterinary practices in Virginia, Wyoming, and Colorado.

Only with accurate information can pet parents be effective advocates for their animals.

She has also appeared on radio and television in her role as veterinary consultant. In her free time, Jennifer enjoys hanging out with her husband, daughter, son, and pets, particularly when they can take advantage of the wonderful outdoor activities that Colorado has to offer.
