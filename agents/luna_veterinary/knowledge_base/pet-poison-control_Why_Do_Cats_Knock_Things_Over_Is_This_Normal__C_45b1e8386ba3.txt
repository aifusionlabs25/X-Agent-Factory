Why Do Cats Knock Things Over? Is This Normal? It’s normal cat behavior—but there are ways to keep your stuff from becoming target practice. By Yvonne Villasenor .

Q: My cat loves knocking everything off the counters—cups, pens, even toilet paper rolls! He seems to enjoy doing it (maybe a little too much). But why do cats knock things over? Is it normal? A: Yes, it’s completely normal for cats to knock things over. It’s part of their playful and mischievous nature. Cats can knock things over for several reasons, ranging from instincts and curiosity to attention-seeking and boredom. We talked with Mieshelle Nagelschneider , cat behaviorist and owner of The Cat Behavior Clinic in Seattle ; and Stephen Quandt, CFTBS, founder of Stephen Quandt Feline Behavior Associates, LLC , in New York City to learn more about this quirky and chaotic behavior . Why Do Cats Knock Things Over? Generally, cats knock things over because they want something—whether it be to entertain themselves, get your attention, or find out what those clear doohickeys are that you drink your water out of. Here are the most common reasons cats knock things over, according to our experts. Curiosity Curiosity is in cats’ DNA. In addition to their exploratory nature, they’re also incredibly observant. So, when they see us going about our day and picking up certain objects, this can contribute to why they focus on things, like water glasses left on the counter, Nagelschneider says. Consider giving your cat something more appropriate and interesting to stick their paws in or to try to knock over, like the Catit Senses Cat Digger Slow Feeder or the TRIXIE Activity Fun Board . This also encourages them to work for their food.

If your feline friend has an affinity for knocking items off counters, it’s because of the excitement of the movement of prey—much like they would bat a stuffed mouse toy across the floor, Nagelschneider says. In this case, the glass of water you set on the counter is the prey.

(On their terms, of course.) One of the ways they ask for—er, command—that attention is by engaging in certain behaviors, such as knocking objects off surfaces, rubbing against your leg , and staring at you . Our experts say that cats may learn that the behavior of knocking things over elicits a response from us. As a result, they act out to gain our attention. A simple solution to this is spending more time bonding with your cat and showering them with as much affection as they’ll allow. Boredom Cats are bright, inquisitive, and athletic. If they find their environment too mundane or they don’t have enough enrichment , this could result in boredom , prompting them to find ways to keep themselves entertained. “Cats are easily bored, and so knocking things over becomes a type of play-based behavior,” Quandt says. Providing your cat with different play options, such as the Frisco cat toy variety pack and puzzle toys , like the Nina Ottosson by Outward Hound Buggin’ Out , can help keep them mentally stimulated.

If you notice that your cat always seems to be hungry despite being fed appropriate portion sizes, it’s best to consult your vet to find out what the underlying cause may be. If you have a hard time keeping your cat on a regular feeding schedule, consider an automatic cat feeder that dispenses pre-portioned meals at scheduled times.

A cat who has excess energy might resort to zoomies , tipping over random objects, and getting into mischief as a way to put that energy to use. Fortunately, there are plenty of activities and games you can play with your cat to help them stay physically and mentally active—without the unexpected destruction. How Do I Stop My Cat From Knocking Things Over? Knocking things off surfaces is normal cat behavior, but in some instances, it could be considered highly undesirable, especially if repeated often, Quandt says. The good news is you can manage or redirect the behavior—and keep your belongings in place and intact. Here are tips to help stop your cat from knocking things over: Play With Your Cat Scheduling playtime with food rewards can be a great way to bond with your cat and stop them from knocking things over. Quandt recommends relieving your BFF’s boredom with a range of toys, such as interactive cat toys , puzzle feeders, teaser wands , toys with catnip , and motion-sensitive toys . Some fun options to try are the Frisco butterfly cat tracks toy , Catstages Kitty Cube puzzle toy , SmartyKat Instincts electronic motion cat toy, and Frisco Fabric Teaser Wand Cat Toy . You can also make your own cat toys using household items !

Many cats naturally love vertical spaces, meaning anything on shelves may end up on the floor. You can give them their own space to safely explore and laze by installing cat shelves , like the Frisco cat bridge wall or Armarkat real wood cat wall additions , or providing tall cat trees such as the Frisco faux fur cat tree .

Nagelschneider recommends a seeking circuit toy, like the Catit Senses Super Roller Circuit toy , where the prey hides so your cat can hear it but not always see it. This is the best way to satisfy your cat’s need to see prey run and hide, because it’s that part of the hunt that triggers the biggest feel-good brain chemical release, she explains.

You can also increase the frequency of their daily meals. Consult your vet for personalized recommendations on how much to feed your cat . Ultimately, the key to keeping your feline friend from knocking over your belongings is giving them something better to do, Quandt says.
