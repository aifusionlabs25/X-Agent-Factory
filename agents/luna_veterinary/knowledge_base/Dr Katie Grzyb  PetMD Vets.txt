Dr. Katie Grzyb received her Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine from Ross University in 2009. She continued her clinical training at University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana and, following this, completed a rotating internship in small animal medicine and surgery. She worked as an emergency clinician at Veterinary Emergency and Referral Group in Brooklyn, NY, where she discovered her love of urgent care and emergency medicine. She ventured into a small animal general practice in Brooklyn, NY, where she quickly took on the role of medical director and honed her skills diagnosing and treating both acute and chronic medical conditions.  Katie has special interests in critical care and stabilization, soft tissue surgery and the human-animal bond.
Originally from Rhode Island, Katie enjoys laughing with family and friends, going to the theater, spending time near the ocean, and serenading others with her karaoke skills (whether by request or force).  She also considers herself quite the foodie. Her greatest joy is spoiling her high maintenance tortoiseshell feline, Ruby Sassafrass and her new puppy, Cecilia (Cece Bling).
