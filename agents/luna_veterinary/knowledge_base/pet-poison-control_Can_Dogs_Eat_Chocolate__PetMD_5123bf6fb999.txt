View 8 More + Our pups often have a knack for getting into things they shouldn’t and eating any type of food that drops from the table. It’s important to know why dogs can’t eat chocolate, and what to do if your dog eats any type of chocolate. Key Takeaways Dogs should never eat chocolate due to its toxic chemicals, such as theobromine and caffeine, which can cause severe health issues. All types of chocolate pose a risk, with baker’s chocolate and cocoa powder being the most dangerous to dogs. Symptoms of chocolate poisoning in dogs may include vomiting, diarrhea, increased heart rate, tremors, and seizures. If your dog eats chocolate, immediately contact your vet or Pet Poison Helpline to determine next steps. Can Dogs Eat Chocolate? No, dogs should never be allowed to eat chocolate. Chocolate contains certain ingredients that a dog’s digestive system cannot break down, causing them to develop gastrointestinal, neurological, or cardiovascular issues. It’s important to keep dogs away from an area, like a kitchen, where chocolate is accessible. It’s easy for someone to drop chocolate on a floor or for a dog to get access to a counter if no one is looking. Why Can’t Dogs Eat Chocolate? Chocolate contains caffeine and an ingredient called theobromine, which are both part of a group of substances called methylxanthines. These chemicals affect certain receptors and hormones in dogs and other animals (such as cats), leading to stimulation of the heart and nervous system. When considering how much chocolate is actually toxic to dogs, the answer is that it depends on the type of chocolate, how much was ingested, and the size and health of the dog. Types of Chocolate That Cause Poisoning in Dogs All chocolate is not created equally, and the methylxanthine content of chocolate varies depending on the type. Here are types of chocolate and their levels of methylxanthines. Which Types of Chocolate Are More Toxic for Dogs? All types of chocolate can be toxic to dogs, but the amount of chocolate and type ingested are important factors to consider, because the concentration of caffeine and theobromine can vary. In general, darker, more bitter chocolate is the most dangerous for dogs. This is because dark chocolate contains more theobromine per ounce when compared to other types of chocolate. Type of Chocolate Concentration Level of Methylxanthines White Chocolate Almost no concentration Milk Chocolate Low concentration Dark/Semi Sweet Chocolate Moderate concentration Baker’s Chocolate High concentration Cocoa Powder High concentration While white chocolate has virtually no methylxanthines, milk chocolate contains a low concentration, and dark and semi-sweet chocolate have a moderate concentration. Baker’s chocolate and cocoa powder contain the highest concentration of methylxanthines. Therefore, the type of chocolate, amount of chocolate, and size of your dog are all very important in determining if your dog ate a dangerous amount. If your dog ate chocolate, no matter how much, reach out to Pet Poison Helpline at 855-764-7661 or your veterinarian for more information and to determine the next steps for your pup. You can quickly use PetMD’s chocolate toxicity in dogs calculator if you know how much chocolate your dog ingested and their weight. Keep in mind, this tool does not replace the advice of a vet or a toxin specialist, so still reach out to the Pet Poison Helpline or your vet. Symptoms of Chocolate Poisoning in Dogs Common signs and symptoms of chocolate poisoning in a dog depend on the amount of chocolate ingested and the size of the dog. However, common signs may include: Vomiting Diarrhea Increased thirst Increased urination Restlessness/Anxiety Tremors Seizures Walking unsteadily ( ataxia ) Coma My Dog Ate Chocolate. Now What? If your dog ate chocolate, gather as much information as you can about the type and amount of chocolate ingested. If your dog ate baked goods, grab the recipe or box mix that was used (if it’s available) to have it handy when speaking with a toxin specialist at the Pet Poison Helpline or with your vet. You’ll also want to see if your dog ate any packaging or wrappers from the chocolate, which could create an internal obstruction. Call your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline with the above information to determine if your dog can be monitored at home or if they need to be brought to a vet immediately. Treatment of Chocolate Poisoning in Dogs If your dog eats chocolate, do not make your dog throw up at home unless you are instructed to do so by your veterinarian or the Pet Poison Helpline. Without guidance from a vet, this can lead to other dangerous health issues, including aspiration pneumonia . Treatment for chocolate poisoning in a dog depends on the size of your dog and how much they ate. If your vet or the Pet Poison Helpline recommend that you head to a vet clinic, treatment for your dog’s chocolate poisoning will likely start with decontamination, either through inducing vomiting or with medical-grade charcoal . Medications may be introduced and fluids may be given to your pup to help with hydration. If a dog ingests a high dosage of chocolate, they may need to stay in the clinic overnight or longer for monitoring and until all symptoms have been cleared. With immediate medical care, a dog should not have a long-term impact from chocolate poisoning. How to Prevent Dogs from Eating Chocolate Prevention is the best way to avoid an accidental chocolate ingestion, which means pet parents and houseguests should be mindful when snacking on a tasty treat. If you have chocolate out in the kitchen during an event, especially during the holiday season , ensure your dog doesn’t have access to the area. Use a pet gate to keep your dog out of trouble. Dogs can easily smell food through wrappers and packaging, so even if the chocolate is wrapped or in a box, your dog can still find it. They may even eat the packaging as well. That’s why it’s important that all pantry doors and cabinets are locked, especially if you have a dog who can easily swipe doors open with their nose or paw. A pet-safe lock, like the MyPet Safety Grip and Glide Cabinet Lock or the MyPet Safety Paws Door Paw-Tector is ideal to invest in. If your pup likes going through the garbage, a lock or pet-safe strap lock is a good way to keep that trash can off-limits, especially when leftover wrappers or chocolate are discarded. Holidays such as Halloween, Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and Easter usually involve a lot of chocolate. Keep any candy for these and other occasions locked away where your dog cannot reach it—and don’t forget that pet gate. It’s also important to educate family and visitors on the importance of not sharing treats with your dog, and to seek medical help immediately if they spot your dog eating chocolate.
