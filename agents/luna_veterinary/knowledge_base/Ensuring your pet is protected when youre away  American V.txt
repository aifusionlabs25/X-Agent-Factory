Ensuring your pet is protected when you're away
The reservations are made, your bags are packed, and you’re ready for your trip—confident your pet will be in good hands while you’re gone. But have you thought about what happens if your pet needs urgent medical attention and you’re unavailable to make decisions?
These steps can help ensure your pet gets the care they need in your absence—just the way you’d want.
Step
1: Choose a trusted emergency decision‑maker
Whether you’re leaving your pet with family or friends, a pet sitter, a boarding facility, or a veterinary clinic, select someone to act as your authorized agent if your pet has an emergency and you can’t be reached. Let this person know:
All possible ways you can be contacted, including contact information for fellow travelers, if appropriate
Your regular veterinarian’s name and contact details
Your preferred emergency veterinary clinic (if you have one) and their contact information
Any medical conditions your pet has that could result in emergency situations (like heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or chronic gastrointestinal disease), and how you would want those emergencies handled
Which treatments or procedures would you
not
authorize without your direct consent (such as major surgeries or advanced diagnostic tests)
Whether or not you authorize them to consent to euthanasia if necessary
Your pet insurance details (provider, policy number, and coverage specifics), if relevant
Any financial limits you wish to set
Your wishes for aftercare if your pet passes away, including what to do with their remains
Step 2: Clarify payment arrangements
As the pet’s owner, you are ultimately responsible for the animal’s veterinary expenses. Discuss with your agent how costs will be handled:
Will your agent pay any bills upfront and be reimbursed by you later?
Do you have pet insurance, and will it directly pay for any expenses?
Have you placed a payment method on file with your regular veterinarian and preferred emergency clinic?
Will you provide your agent with a payment method—such as a credit card, prepaid debit card, or blank check—for emergencies?
If you provide a credit or debit card, contact your card issuer ahead of time to authorize its use for veterinary emergencies while you’re away. This helps prevent payment delays if charges are flagged as unusual activity.
Step
3: Put it in writing
Many pet sitters, boarding services, and veterinary clinics have their own
pet care emergency authorization form
they ask clients to complete. If you’ve specified a particular veterinarian or veterinary emergency clinic for your pet’s care, check with them ahead of time to find out exactly what documentation they need to both treat your pet and process payment on your behalf.
Whether you use their form or create your own:
Clearly state the details in steps 1 and 2.
Include the identity and contact information of your authorized agent.
If you’ve appointed more than one agent, specify who has final decision-making authority in emergencies to avoid delays in your pet’s care.
Sign the form and share it with your agent, your chosen veterinarian or emergency clinic, and anyone else directly involved in your pet’s care.
Step
4: Prepare practical details in advance
A little extra preparation can help make your pet’s care as seamless and stress-free as possible for everyone while you’re away.
If your pet is microchipped, consider adding your agent as an alternate contact in the microchip registry database, so they can be reached if your pet is found.
Stock up on enough pet food, medication, and supplements to last your trip plus a few extra days.
Show your agent where supplies are stored and provide clear instructions for feeding and medication—even if you think your agent already knows.
Share details on your pet’s exercise regimen and any preferences for play or toys.
Let your agent know if it’s okay to give your pet treats and whether to avoid any particular types of treats.
Provide up-to-date medical information, vaccination history (including proof of rabies vaccination), and any relevant care instructions not already covered.
