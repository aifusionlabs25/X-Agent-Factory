In this article:
Discover practical AVMA tools and programs that support veterinarians in caring for animals.
Learn about the role of veterinarians in protecting animal health and welfare.
Veterinarians and veterinary teams are committed to protecting the health and welfare of animals. We don’t just care for animals when they’re sick or injured. We provide preventive care and exams that keep them healthy, work with owners to make sure they get nutritious food, help manage their weight, provide guidance on behavior and training, offer advice on pet selection,
actively explore emerging technologies to improve patient care, and much more.
From pets to livestock, horses, laboratory animals, zoo animals, aquatic animals, wildlife, and beyond, veterinarians’ work preserves the health and welfare of all animal species in all settings.
Animal welfare
Preserving animal welfare means considering all aspects of an animal’s wellbeing. Veterinarians have the knowledge, expertise, and responsibility to protect animal welfare in any setting. AVMA supports this work with resources on topics from breeding to housing to transportation to humane endings.
