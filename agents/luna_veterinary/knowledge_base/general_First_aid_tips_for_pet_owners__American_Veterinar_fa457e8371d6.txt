First aid tips for pet owners Do you know what you would do if your dog ate some chocolate? What if your cat had a seizure? What if your pet was overheating on a hot summer day, or fell down the stairs and started limping? Knowing some basic first aid information and being prepared for emergencies can help you avoid the feelings of panic that may accompany these situations. First aid care is not a substitute for veterinary care, but it may save your pet’s life until you can get them veterinary care. In case of an emergency, call your veterinarian or local veterinary emergency hospital so they can be ready when you arrive. When traveling with your pet , consider bringing a simpler, travel-sized version of the pet first aid kit you keep at home, and have the phone numbers of your veterinarian, the national animal poison control hotline (888-426-4235), and a 24-hour emergency veterinary hospital in the area where you will be visiting. When traveling without your pet, be sure to consider who's in charge while you're away and what they'll need to keep your pet safe and healthy. For your safety An injury may not only cause your pet pain, but also fear and confusion. These things can make even the gentlest of pets unpredictable or even dangerous. To protect you both: Avoid any attempt to hug an injured pet. Keep your face away from your pet’s mouth. Apply a muzzle if your pet threatens to bite. Whenever possible, ask other people to help you move your pet. Remember: Any first aid administered to your pet should be followed by immediate veterinary care. First aid care is not a substitute for veterinary care , but it may save your pet's life until it receives veterinary treatment.

In general, any products that are harmful for people are also harmful for pets. Examples include cleaning products, rodent poisons, and antifreeze. But you also need to be aware of common food items, plants, and other substances that may be harmful to your pet. See common household hazards that may pose a danger to your pet Check the label If your pet's skin or eyes are exposed to a toxic product (such as many cleaning products), check the product label for the instructions for people exposed to the product. If the label instructs you to wash your hands with soap and water if you're exposed, then wash your pet's skin with soap and water (don't get any into their eyes, mouth, or nose). If the label tells you to flush the skin or eyes with water, do this for your pet as soon as possible (if you can do it safely), and immediately call a veterinarian. Get help If you know your pet has swallowed or had contact with something that may be harmful, or if the animal is having seizures, losing consciousness, unconscious, or having difficulty breathing, call your veterinarian, emergency veterinary clinic, the Animal Poison Control Center hotline (888-426-4435), or Pet Poison Helpline (855-764-7661) immediately. A consultation fee may apply for hotline/helpline calls. If possible, have the following information available: Species, breed, age, sex, weight and number of animals involved Symptoms Name/description of the substance in question; amount the animal was exposed to; and how long it's been since your pet ate it or was exposed to it Product container/packaging Collect any material your pet may have vomited or chewed, and place it in a plastic sealable bag to take with you when you bring your animal in for veterinary treatment. add If your pet is injured, bleeding, or bitten Fractures Gently lay your pet on a flat surface for support. If possible and safe, try to stabilize the injury by bandaging or splinting it before moving your pet. Since a poorly applied bandage or splint can do more harm than good, leave this step to the veterinarian if you’re uncertain. While transporting your injured pet to a veterinarian, keep them confined in a small area to reduce the risk of additional injury. Pet carriers work well, or you can use a box or other container (but make sure your pet has enough air). For large dogs, use a board, sled, blanket, or something similar to act as a stretcher. Internal bleeding Signs of internal bleeding include bleeding from nose, mouth, or rectum; coughing up blood; bloody urine; pale gums; collapse; and a weak and rapid pulse. Keep your pet as warm and quiet as possible. Immediately take your pet to the closest veterinary hospital. External wounds Use a clean cloth or towel to apply firm pressure directly over the bleeding site. Avoid checking to see if the bleeding has stopped until you’ve applied pressure for at least three minutes. If the bleeding is severe, immediately take your pet to the closest veterinary hospital. If you see blood soaking through the applied towel/cloth, do not remove it. Instead, add towels on top of previous layers to avoid disturbing any blood clots that might have formed. Burns Flush the burn with room temperature water. This process may be painful so take appropriate precautions, such as applying a muzzle, to avoid being scratched, bitten, or otherwise injured. Cover the burned area with towels dampened with room temperature water. Seek immediate veterinary care. Eye injuries Eye injuries are painful and can quickly worsen, becoming a threat to your pet’s sight. If you can see something in your pet’s eye, such as a piece of dirt or grass, try using saline solution to gently flush out the object. Avoid trying to grab the object with a tool or your fingers. Prevent your pet from rubbing the eye with their paws or against objects, such as furniture, carpeting, or you. Immediately seek veterinary care. Snake bites Assume the snake is poisonous. Seek veterinary care immediately. Try to identify the snake or take a picture of it, if this can be done while remaining out of reach. Do not try to capture or kill the snake. Do not bring the snake into the veterinarian’s office—a photograph will do. add If your pet has heatstroke or goes into shock Heatstroke Signs of heatstroke include rapid breathing/heavy panting, excessive drooling, weakness or drowsiness, confusion, vomiting or diarrhea, and abnormally colored, dry or sticky gums. Take your pet to the closest veterinary hospital as soon as possible, and begin cooling them right away. If your pet is in direct sunlight, move them to a shaded area or comfortably cool indoor environment. Place towels wetted with room-temperature water gently around your pet’s neck, in the armpits, and in the groin area. Rewet and replace the towels every few minutes. Avoid putting your pet in a tub of cool or cold water, which can make their condition worse. If a fan is available, use it to directly blow cool air onto your pet. Shock Signs of shock include a weak pulse, shallow breathing, nervousness, and dazed eyes. This usually follows severe injury or extreme fright. Keep your pet restrained, warm, and quiet. If your pet is unconscious, keep their head level with rest of body. Immediately take your pet to the closest veterinary hospital. add If your pet is having a seizure Keep your pet away from any objects (including furniture) that might hurt them. Do not try to restrain the pet, or startle them out of the seizure. Avoid placing your hands in or near your pet’s mouth. Time the seizure with a watch. After the seizure has stopped, keep your pet as warm and quiet as possible and contact your veterinarian or local emergency hospital. Immediately take your pet to a veterinarian if the animal has had any of the following: Two or more seizures in a 24-hour period A seizure that lasts longer than 5 minutes Seizure activity that doesn’t stop add If your pet is choking Choking pets have difficulty breathing, paw a lot at their mouths, make choking sounds when breathing or coughing, and may have blue-tinged lips and/or tongue. If your pet can still breathe, try to keep them calm and immediately seek veterinary care. If possible without risking injury, open your pet’s mouth and look inside for foreign objects. If you see an object, gently try to remove it by using two hands to open the mouth, then using your fingers to grasp and remove the object. The flat side of a spoon may be used to pull the object closer, if needed. Be careful not to push the object further down the throat. For cats and small dogs, if the object can’t be removed with fingers, gently pick up your pet by their thighs and swing the animal in the air from side to side. If that doesn’t help to dislodge the object, apply forward pressure to the pet’s abdomen just behind the ribcage. For larger dogs, if the object can’t be removed with fingers, try the Heimlich maneuver. If your large dog is standing, place your arms around their belly, just like you would a person, and make a fist with your hands. Place your fist on the soft spot under their ribcage, then push up and forward. If the dog is lying down, place one hand on their back and use the other hand to squeeze the abdomen upward. add If your pet is not breathing Stay calm Open your pet’s mouth, gently grasp the tongue, and pull it forward so the tip is outside the mouth. Quickly check the mouth and throat for any foreign objects blocking the airway. Perform rescue breathing by holding your pet’s mouth closed with your hand and breathing directly into their nose until you see their chest expand. Once the chest expands, continue providing 10 rescue breaths per minute until your pet is breathing on their own or you arrive at the closest veterinary hospital. add If your pet has no heartbeat Start rescue breathing as described for non-breathing pets, then position them and begin chest compressions as follows: For cats and most dogs, gently lay the pet on one side. For barrel-chested dogs (like English Bulldogs), gently lay the pet on their back. For small dogs and cats, use one hand to encircle the bottom of the chest between your thumb and other fingers. Then, squeeze the chest between your thumb and fingers 100-120 times per minute (or to the beat of “Stayin’ Alive”). For barrel-chested dogs, place your hands so that the heels of the hands overlap on the mid breastbone (sternum). For other dogs, place your hands so that the heels overlap over the widest point of the chest or, if the dog is keel-chested (like Greyhounds or Doberman Pinschers), just behind the armpit. Then press down 100-120 times per minute, keeping your elbows locked. If the pet is lying on their side, aim to compress the chest cavity by about one-third (33%) to one-half (50%) of its total width. If the pet is on their back, compress the chest cavity by about one-quarter (25%) of its total width. If you’re alone, alternate the chest compressions with rescue breaths by performing 30 chest compressions and stopping long enough to give two rescue breaths, then repeating. If you have help, one person can give chest compressions and the other can give 10 rescue breaths per minute. Be sure to give rescue breaths with the animal's neck and head aligned with their spine to avoid blocking the airway. Continue until you can hear and feel a heartbeat and your pet is breathing regularly, or you have arrived at the closest veterinary hospital, and they can take over. Please remember that your pet's likelihood of surviving with resuscitation is very low. However, in an emergency it may give your pet their only chance. add First aid kit for pets Keep a kit of basic first aid supplies for the pets in your household. Many items in a family first aid kit can be used for pets, too. Your veterinarian may recommend additional items for your kit based on your pet’s medical condition.
