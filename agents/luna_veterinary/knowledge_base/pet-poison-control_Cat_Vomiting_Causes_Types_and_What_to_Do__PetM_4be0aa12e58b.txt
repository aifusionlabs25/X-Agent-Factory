Have you started any prescribed or over-the-counter medications? What diet, including all treats, is your cat on? Do you have other cats in the house, and if so, are they also vomiting? Is your cat indoor and/or outdoor? How often is your cat vomiting, and what does the vomit look like? Is your cat still eating?

There are several possible causes of cat vomiting, and these questions will help guide your veterinarian in the right direction. Possible reasons why cats throw up can be broken into two categories—gastrointestinal causes and non-gastrointestinal causes. Cat Regurgitation vs. Vomiting Vomiting is the active motion of ejecting contents from a cat’s stomach and small intestines out through their mouth. This is different than regurgitation, which is a passive motion where no force is needed to eject contents through the cat’s mouth. Regurgitation can happen if a cat eats too quickly or if they have a hairball , whereas vomiting is usually due to an underlying illness. Vomited contents will appear digested, while regurgitated material is undigested. You might also mistake these for coughing if you didn’t witness anything coming out. If you can’t determine if your cat is coughing or if cat is regurgitating, the best thing to do is to take a video, to show your veterinarian. They can help you determine whether it really is vomiting, and if so, why your cat is throwing up. Here’s some helpful information on cat vomiting causes and possible treatments. Acute vs. Chronic Vomiting in Cats Acute vomiting refers to a sudden onset of vomiting due to eating something they shouldn’t have, intestinal parasites , pancreatitis , or a bacterial or viral Infection, just to name a few possible causes. Once the cause is treated, acute vomiting quickly resolves. Chronic vomiting generally occurs in cats with underlying diseases that must be managed over time. For example, cats with inflammatory bowel disease , cancer , kidney disease , or hyperthyroidism may experience bouts of vomiting off and on for weeks to months simply due to their chronic illnesses.

This can happen if you are only feeding your cat in the morning and they go 24 hours without food, or it can happen when cats are anorexic. Blood . Cats may vomit blood if they have ulcerations, or if your cat vomits several times in a row, this can cause an irritation of the stomach lining and esophagus because of the increased acid. White Foam. White foam in cat vomit is often seen because the lining of the stomach and/or small intestines is inflamed from an underlying issue. Water/Clear Liquid. If your cat is vomiting clear liquid, it can be the fluid contents of the stomach, or your cat might have drunk too much water. Worms. The most common type of worm seen in cat vomit is roundworms . If your cat vomits a worm, it is important to bring this to your veterinarian so they can treat the issue appropriately. Food. Cats who eat too much or too fast can vomit food, and it typically it appears in a tubular shape. Hairballs . Cats can occasionally vomit hairballs, especially cats who overgroom or cats with long hair. Black Liquid. Black vomit in cats is usually indicative of digested blood further down the intestinal tract and can be seen with ulcerations, foreign bodies, or even inflammation in the intestines. Green Vomit . If your cat is throwing up green vomit, this usually indicates that the food or substance was brought up from the small intestines. The mixture of the vomitus with bile can turn it green. Mucus. Mucus is typically seen if your cat is regurgitating and not vomiting. If you see mucus, it is very important to determine if your cat is actually vomiting or if they are regurgitating.
