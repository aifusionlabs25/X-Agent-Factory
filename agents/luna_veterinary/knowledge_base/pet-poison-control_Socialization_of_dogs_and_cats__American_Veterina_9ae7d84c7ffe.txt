Socialization of dogs and cats Adopting a new kitten or puppy is a wonderful and exciting experience. It is also a time where a little extra planning can help a new pet develop the calm and confident temperament that will help them enjoy life to the fullest. Socialization is the process of preparing a dog or cat to enjoy interactions and be comfortable with other animals, people, places, and activities. The best time to start this process is between 3 and 14 weeks of age for puppies, and 3 and 9 weeks of age for kittens—when the animals are most open to learning about their environment, their littermates, people, and other animals of the same or different species. During this period, a broad range of positive experiences can help prevent fearful, reactive, or aggressive responses in the future. Advice for new puppy and kitten owners Here's how to help set up your pet for success: When adopting a puppy or kitten, ask for a socialization plan that includes any socialization the animal already may have received and recommendations for future experiences. Work with your veterinarian to map out a plan to gradually expose your pet to the animals, people, environments, activities, and objects that will be part of their new life. Include a broad range of positive experiences in the types of environments your pet is likely to encounter throughout their life. Provide praise, play, and treats to reward positive or neutral engagement in their surroundings. Allow your pet to withdraw if they seem uncomfortable. Move at a pace appropriate for your pet's personality. Consider enrolling your pet in well-managed puppy or kitten socialization classes, which expose animals to new experiences in a safe, controlled setting. Keep puppies or kittens that are not fully vaccinated away from animals with an unknown vaccination status or places those animals may have been, such as outdoor parks. Continue to reward your dog or cat for calm or playful responses to social interactions throughout their life. Your veterinarian can help you ensure your socialization plan covers all the bases for your pet to grow confident and well adjusted. They also can provide recommendations if the socialization period has passed and/or your pet needs more help, including possible referral to an animal behavior specialist.
