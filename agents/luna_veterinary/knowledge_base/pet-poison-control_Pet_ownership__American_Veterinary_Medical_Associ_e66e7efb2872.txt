Pet ownership Our pets are always there for us, and we want what’s best for them. There are certain actions we can take to keep pets happy and healthy for as long as possible and build the bond we share with them. Your veterinarian can answer any questions you have and make recommendations tailored to the needs of your current or future pet, you, and your family. Selecting a pet Choose wisely Although it can be easy to fall in love with a new animal friend, avoid making any impulsive decisions about adopting them into your household. Instead, carefully select a pet that’s suited to your family (including any other pets), home, and lifestyle. Some pets like fish, birds, pocket pets, reptiles, and amphibians require special veterinary care, so make sure there’s a veterinarian in your area who can provide that care. See tips for selecting the right pet. Make a commitment Make plans for the full potential lifespan of your pet. Some pets, like small rodents, may live for only a few years, but large parrots can live for more than 100 years! Make an investment Recognize that pet ownership requires an investment of time, effort, and money. Think about the needs your pet will have for food, shelter, veterinary care, training, exercise, and more. Know your limits Keep only the type and number of pets that you’re able to provide a suitable home for. This includes nutritious food, adequate water and shelter, timely veterinary care, and sufficient exercise and companionship. Some types of pets need more frequent exercise, feeding, or attention, and may not be good choices for owners who have busy lifestyles or spend long periods away from home. Investigate whether local laws or your housing arrangements limit your choice of pet. Consider your family Think about your current household members—both people and pets. Certain types of pets may not be suitable for households with young children, elderly people, or immunocompromised individuals due to the risk of infectious disease or harm to those people or the pets themselves. Also consider your current pet(s) and whether a new pet would be compatible with them. Caring for your pet Keep your pet happy and healthy Partner with your veterinarian to support your pet’s long-term health and wellbeing. Regular checkups are key, as they allow your veterinarian to get to know you and your pet and to catch problems early, before they become bigger and costlier. Follow your veterinarian’s recommendations for vaccinations, parasite control, dental care, nutrition, weight management, and other pet needs. Provide exercise and mental stimulation as appropriate for your pet’s age, breed, and health status. Your veterinarian can help with this. Socialize and train your pet—this can strengthen your relationship with them and improve both their wellbeing and the wellbeing of other animals and people. Your veterinarian whenever you notice changes in your pet or their behavior that could indicate something is wrong. Seek timely treatment for any illnesses or injuries.
