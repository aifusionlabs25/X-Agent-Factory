Loving your pet, managing the costs
Pets enrich our lives with love, joy, and companionship, and we want to do what we can to keep them feeling their best. This includes making sure they get the veterinary care they need, which involves a financial investment.
Veterinary teams are deeply committed to your pet's health and wellbeing. The fees they charge help support the skilled staff, equipment, and facilities needed to provide high-quality care—not just for your pet but for every animal they see.
By understanding the costs you may encounter over your pet’s lifetime—and exploring the many options available to reduce and manage these costs, you can feel better prepared when making decisions about your pet’s health care.
Talk openly with your veterinarian
While costs can vary widely depending on species, breed, age, and individual health needs, it’s helpful to consider the main categories of expenses that typically come with pet ownership:
Initial costs
: Adoption or purchase fees, spay/neuter surgery, microchipping, and first vaccinations.
Basic care
: Food, treats, toys, bedding, litter or waste bags, and routine supplies.
Routine preventive care
: Regular checkups and other preventive care like vaccines, parasite prevention, and dental care.
Ongoing needs
: Grooming, training, boarding, or pet-sitting when you travel.
Unexpected  veterinary
care
: Nonroutine or emergency care for illnesses, accidents, or chronic health conditions, including diagnostic tests, medications, chemotherapy, special diets, surgery, hospital stays, and other care.
Senior and end-of-life care
: More frequent veterinary visits, treatments or accommodations to keep pets comfortable, euthanasia, and aftercare like cremation or burial.
Over a pet’s lifetime, these expenses can add up to
tens of thousands of dollars
.
Stay ahead with preventive care
Routine preventive care
as mentioned above is one of the best ways to keep your pet healthy and avoid larger medical bills down the road. This includes veterinary checkups at least once a year, and more frequent checkups for senior pets and those with medical issues. The cost of preventive care usually is much less than the cost of treating the diseases or problems it targets. Plus, early detection of health issues—as through regular checkups—can mean more treatment options and better outcomes, often at a lower cost than if found later on. If your veterinary clinic offers wellness plans, this might let you spread out the costs of preventive care over time. Some pet insurance plans also help cover preventive care services.
Support your pet’s nutrition and healthy weight
Providing your pet with nutritious food and opportunities for exercise and play also can help prevent disease and give your pet the best chance of a long, quality life. Portion control is just as important, as excess calories can quickly lead to obesity—a condition linked to heart disease, diabetes, joint issues, and other health conditions. If you’re unsure about the type or amount of food to provide, your veterinarian can help you decide.
Good nutrition doesn’t have to break the bank. In fact, “premium” foods aren’t always nutritionally better than less expensive options, although they may contain different ingredients. The key is to check for the Association of Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) nutritional adequacy statement—usually found in small print on the back or side of the pet food bag or can. This statement confirms that the food is complete and balanced and meets the nutritional needs of the indicated pet species, life stage, and condition (growth, maintenance, gestation/lactation, or all life stages). And it’s found on a wide variety of dog and cat foods, in a variety of price ranges.
Avoid “Dr. Google”
Searching online—or asking an artificial intelligence (AI) tool—for information to help guide health care decisions for your pet may seem like a way to save money on veterinary bills, but this can be risky. It’s often hard to separate reliable advice from misleading or incomplete information, and nothing online can replace a thorough, hands-on examination by your veterinarian. Skipping that step could lead to a missed or incorrect diagnosis, putting your pet’s health at risk and potentially costing you much more in the long run.
Shop around for pet medications
With a prescription from your veterinarian, you choose from several sources when purchasing your pet’s medications. Many pet owners buy directly from their veterinary clinic, but other options include pet supply or feed stores, licensed online pharmacies, and human pharmacies.
It’s a good idea to start with your veterinary clinic. Their prices may be more competitive than you expect, and some clinics will even match online pharmacy prices if you ask. If cost is a concern, talk with your veterinarian about whether a lower-cost option—such as a generic drug or pet-safe human version—is available.
Buying from your veterinarian also has extra benefits. You can trust that you’re getting the right product, and certain manufacturers guarantee their products only when they’re bought through veterinarians. Plus, you’ll save time and extra trips, since you usually can take your pet’s medication home right after your visit.
If your pet has been prescribed long-term medication, consider opting for a subscription or automatic refills, which may reduce costs and improve convenience.
If you decide to purchase online, always use a reputable pharmacy with a valid license in your state. You can check a pharmacy’s license status with your
state pharmacy board
. Avoid any source—especially outside the U.S.—that claims you don’t need a prescription or sells medications not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These products may be illegal or counterfeit, or may not even contain real medication, all of which could endanger your pet.
Important safety reminder
: Never give your pet any human medications or other drugs not specifically prescribed for your pet without first consulting your veterinarian. While it might seem like a way to save money, many
human medications
are dangerous—or even deadly—for pets.
Prepare for the unexpected
No one expects an emergency. But injuries, sudden illnesses, or chronic conditions can happen to any pet. The sooner you seek veterinary treatment for a pet’s illness or injury, the better the chance you’ll avoid the need for more advanced (and expensive) care.
If you're able to set aside a small emergency fund or purchase
pet insurance
, this can help you manage unexpected expenses and make a big difference when making tough decisions under pressure. It’s a good idea to start pet insurance while your pet is still healthy, before they develop any conditions that might be considered pre-existing (and, therefore, possibly not covered).
Ask about payment options
If you're worried about costs, you’re not alone. Your veterinarian wants to help you find the best possible solution for you and your pet. In many cases, a range of care options is available, each of which can provide good results. By sharing your concerns, you and your veterinarian can work together on a personalized care plan that fits both your pet’s needs and your circumstances.
Many clinics offer payment plans, deferred payments, and financing options or credit plans to help with your pet's care. Not all clinics are able to offer these choices, but it's always worth asking.
Consider community clinics and support programs
In some areas, nonprofit and low-cost clinics offer basic veterinary services for pet owners with limited incomes or those experiencing homelessness. These clinics typically focus on preventive care and may have limited capacity for emergencies or advanced diagnostic tests. But they can be a valuable resource for routine checkups, vaccinations, and spay/neuter services.
Seek out financial assistance
If you're unable to pay for necessary care and can't make financial arrangements or find a nonprofit or low-cost program, there may still be help available. Some veterinary schools and nonprofit organizations may be able to provide financial assistance for pet owners who can demonstrate a need. Another option is crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe or Waggle.org.
The AVMA does not endorse any specific financial aid program, nor can we assist you with securing financial help for veterinary care. However, we've compiled a list of organizations that may be able to help. A few tips:
Be sure to visit each organization's website for up-to-date information, eligibility criteria, and application instructions.
Read each program's eligibility guidelines carefully before applying.
Provide any necessary documentation that supports your application.
Reach out to your local veterinary medical association or humane organization, who may keep a list of additional local resources.
Even if you've been turned down elsewhere, keep asking—new opportunities can arise.
Do you need pet insurance?
Pet insurance can offset some of the costs of your pet's healthcare. Talk to your veterinarian and research your pet health insurance options.
