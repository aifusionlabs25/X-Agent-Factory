Lethargy in dogs is a symptom that can occur with several health issues in pups.
Let’s look at all that you need to know about lethargy in dogs, from how to tell lethargy apart from tiredness, possible causes, and when to call your vet.
Key Takeaways
Lethargy in dogs looks like they are not feeling well. Lethargic dogs sleep more, don’t participate in normal activities, move slower, and hide.
Lethargy in dogs can be caused by several medical and physical conditions, making it difficult to know what the underlying cause.
Your vet may offer specific treatments such as pain medicine, fluids if your dog is dehydrated, antibiotics to treat lethargy in dogs.
What Is Dog Lethargy?
Lethargy in dogs is a lack of energy and enthusiasm.
But what does that mean for your dog?
It's an important distinction to know if your dog is truly lethargic (which could indicate a medical issue) or is just tired. It may be difficult to make that distinction, but you know your dog better than anyone. Recognizing when your dog is lethargic and being proactive helps your veterinarian give your dog the best care.
A dog that is lethargic is unusually inactive and not interested in getting up and doing normal activities. The severity of lethargy can vary but ranges from just moving more slowly to really having no interest in walks or play.
If you are concerned that your dog is lethargic and not acting like they typically do, call your vet to get them checked out sooner rather than later.
A tired dog may just be sleeping but is easily roused and ready to pop up if they hear
a bag of treats
or the jingle of
the leash
. If you have a good explanation for your dog to be tired, then that may be the case.
If you have taken a very long walk or had a large amount of exercise (especially in the heat), then your dog may sleep for hours afterward. If your dog has been at day care or a boarding kennel, they may be excited and on alert most of the time there and then come home and just crash.
If there is no unusual activity or exertion that would cause your pet to sleep more or be acting more tired than usual, then you may be dealing with lethargy, and your dog may need veterinary attention.
What Causes Lethargy in Dogs?
There are several possible causes of lethargy in dogs. A few common reasons a dog may be lethargic include:
Infection
Viral, bacterial, fungal
External parasites (
tick disease
or
fleas
)
Internal parasites (
intestinal worms
)
Pain
New medication or
flea/tick prevention
Heart disease
Respiratory disease (
pneumonia
,
bronchitis
)
Neurologic disease
Kidney disease
Liver disease
Addison’s disease
Anemia
Diabetes
Hypothyroidism
Stress or anxiety

Symptoms of Lethargy in Dogs
Lethargy in dogs is almost always a secondary symptom of a primary underlying condition. If your dog is lethargic, it’s most likely not the only symptom of illness they have.
Typically, a lethargic dog will be a less active version of their normal selves with other signs of illness.
However, lethargy in dogs might also be the only symptom visible to pet parents. Once your veterinarian
performs a physical exam
and runs some diagnostic testing, more symptoms usually arise.
Symptoms of lethargy include:
Sleeping more
Hiding in places they do not normally frequent
Moving slower than normal
Not as active as usual even with favorite toys or playtime
Uninterested in normal activities
such as meals
or daily walks
Slow to react to stimuli
Not acting like themselves

When Is Dog Lethargy an Emergency?
If you are concerned that your dog is lethargic and not acting like they typically do, call your vet to get them checked out sooner rather than later.
Take your dog to the veterinarian immediately if they are lethargic and have any of the following symptoms:
Pale gum color
(can indicate internal bleeding and can lead to
life-threatening anemia
)
Distended abdomen (can be
a sign of bloat
or other abdominal emergencies)
Labored breathing
or
blue or purple tongue color
(often due to heart or lung problems that need urgent medical attention)
Stomach upset
(
vomiting
,
diarrhea
or change in appetite) lasting more than 48 hours
Shaking/tremors
Ataxia
Seizures
Change in mentation (dull or nonresponsive)
Treatment for a Lethargic Dog
Your veterinarian will first perform a physical exam.
Once they find where the problem may be coming from, they will recommend diagnostic tests, usually starting
with blood work
and
X-rays
.
These tests will help the vet do a thorough check of all body systems and determine if there is something serious going on with your dog’s internal organs.
Your vet may offer specific treatments such as
pain medicine
, fluids if your dog is
dehydrated
, antibiotics (commonly
Clavamox
and
Doxycycline
) if there’s an infection, or anti-nausea medicine (such as
Cerenia
or
Ondansetron
) if your dog is vomiting.
Unfortunately, lethargy is not often something you can remedy at home. This is because a pet parent will not know the root cause of a dog’s lethargy.
Until you can see a vet, keep your pup in a calm, quiet place under your direct supervision, ensuring they have access to food and fresh water (if they are able to tolerate it).
Seek treatment early. Do not wait until your pup is severely ill and it becomes an emergency.
