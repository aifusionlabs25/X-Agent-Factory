What Is Kidney Failure in Cats?
Kidneys serve many vital roles in the body, including filtering and removing waste in the form of urine.
Kidneys maintain proper hydration by balancing water and electrolytes, creating the hormones responsible for red blood cell production, and regulating blood pressure. In addition, the kidneys help modify vitamin D so it can be used by the body.
Like people, cats have two kidneys, one on each side of the abdomen.
Unfortunately, kidney failure can occur when these organs become too damaged to work properly.
Kidney failure usually develops because of
chronic kidney disease
. It takes a kidney losing more than 75% of its function before you start to see changes in routine
blood work
(such as in creatinine levels).
Kidney failure in cats is a life-threatening situation, though treatments, like
special therapeutic diets to support kidney function
, can help extend their life.
Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to managing the disease and helping to maintain your cat’s comfort and well-being.
Types of Kidney Failure in Cats
Kidney failure in cats can be described as acute or chronic.
Acute Kidney Failure in Cats
Also called acute renal failure (ARF), acute kidney failure in cats occurs when the kidneys are suddenly damaged, usually within hours or days. This may be due to
poison
or from a fast-acting infection.
Cats with ARF may regain some kidney function with treatment, supportive care, and time, depending on the cause.
Even with treatment,
ARF is terminal in about 50% of cases
.
However, cats that do survive the initial cause usually have a better outcome compared to cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Chronic Kidney Failure in Cats
Chronic kidney failure, or chronic kidney disease (CKD), eventually leads to end-stage renal failure, or ESRF, which is considered stage 4 of kidney disease.
In CKD, a gradual loss of kidney tissue occurs over a period of months (must be >2 months to be considered CKD) or years due to underlying genetic factors, chronic infections, age, cancer, or other underlying medical conditions.
Clinical signs of chronic kidney disease show up when about two-thirds of normal kidney tissue has been lost.
As it worsens, medical management becomes ineffective in helping the kidneys perform their crucial roles.
Symptoms of Kidney Failure in Cats
Clinical signs of kidney failure in cats differ slightly, depending on if the condition is acute or final stages of CKD.
In cats with
acute kidney failure
, symptoms include:
Sudden onset of
decreased appetite
or anorexia
Lethargy
or listlessness
Vomit
, sometimes
tinged with blood
Diarrhea
or
bloody diarrhea
Weight loss
Ammonia-like odor to the breath
(due to uremic toxins building up in the blood)
Changes in urination (
increased frequency
, large amounts or cessation)
Drinking more water than normal
, usually excessive
Abdominal pain due to swollen kidneys (seen in cases of acute kidney failure in cats)
Seizures
In cats with
end-stage kidney failure
associated with chronic kidney disease, clinical signs include:
Anorexia/refusal to eat
Vomiting
Weight loss
Lethargy, excessive sleepiness
Dehydration
Confusion (possibly pacing and restlessness)
Changes in behavior (
withdrawn
,
irritability
)
Uncontrolled urination
or
defecation
Drinking more water than normal
Ammonia-like odor to the breath
Seizures
Decreasing body temperature
Greasy, unkempt, thin hair coat
Stages of Kidney Failure in Cats
Stages of kidney failure in cats is determined by their lab values as well as the symptoms they have.
Let’s look at each stage of kidney failure in cats.
Stage 1
Kidneys are damaged but no azotemia present. Azotemia is the measurement of waste accumulation in the blood as evident by increased creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN).
No clinical signs or symptoms noted.
This stage has the greatest chance of successful treatment. However, since there are no signs or lab value changes, it’s very rare to diagnose a cat with stage 1 kidney disease.
Stage 2
Kidneys have started to decrease in their ability to filter waste out of the blood and azotemia is noted in blood work. The urine starts to become more diluted (containing more water) from poor kidney function.
Urine specific gravity (USG) will decrease on urinalysis.
Most cats have no signs or symptoms at this stage, but some cats will start to drink more water and urine more frequently/increased volume of urine produced (PU/PD).
Stage 3
The kidneys continue to have decreased filtering ability. Azotemia becomes worse as more waste is concentrated in the blood.
Cats will begin to show clinical signs.
Stage 4
This final stage of kidney disease continues to worsen the kidneys’ ability to filter waste from the blood. This toxin buildup in the blood not only affects the kidneys but will start to affect other organs of the body.
Cats begin to feel and act very sick.
A cat’s bones can become soft and
break easily
. Brittle jaw bones can cause young cats’ teeth to
fall out
.
What Causes Kidney Failure in Cats?
Acute kidney failure has numerous causes, but it can be categorized as due to toxins or from an underlying medical issue.
Toxin exposure
may be caused by ingesting:
Ethylene glycol
(antifreeze)
Lilies
(all parts of the plant and the water in the vase are toxic by ingestion or inhalation)
NSAIDs
for people, such as
acetaminophen
or ibuprofen
Heavy metals like arsenic,
lead
, or mercury
Rat poisons
Underlying medical issues
can include:
Urethral obstructions
(inability to urinate)
Low blood pressure
Clotting disorders
Heart disease
Pyelonephritis
(infection in the kidneys)
Parasitic infections (toxoplasmosis or kidney worms)
Tick-borne diseases
Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)
Trauma
or
severe allergic reactions
that result in
shock
Chronic kidney disease eventually progresses to end-stage kidney disease and kidney failure.
How quickly this happens is hard to predict. It’s very common in geriatric cats, and
some breeds have a higher risk
, such as:
Abyssinians
Burmese
Maine Coons
Persians
Ragdolls
Russian Blues
Siamese
Other risk factors
include:
Tumors and cancer
(such as
lymphoma
)
Viruses specific to cats, such as
feline leukemia virus (FeLV)
or
feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)
Chronic pyelonephritis (a slow-developing infection in the kidneys)
Underlying genetic disorders like polycystic kidney disease or
amyloidosis
Immune-mediated disorders
Previous acute renal failure/acute kidney injuries that did not fully respond to treatment
Underlying medical conditions, like
hyperthyroidism
Use of certain medications
How Vets Diagnose Kidney Failure in Cats
In cases of acute renal failure in cats, blood work,
urine samples
, and imaging (X-rays and ultrasound) will likely be performed to diagnose the condition and help determine the best course of treatment.
Your cat will be thoroughly
examined by their veterinarian
and their blood pressure will be obtained as well. Your veterinarian will look for signs of:
Anemia
Elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine
Abnormal hydration levels, by measuring electrolyte concentration (sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus)
Dilute urine or signs of infection in the urine
High
or low blood pressure
Large or small kidneys
Kidney Failure in Cats Treatment
Options for treating end-stage kidney failure in cats are limited.
They include strategies to manage kidney disease such as special diet, supplements, and anti-nausea medication.
With proper treatment, cats with as little as 5% kidney function can survive for a long time.
One of the most important treatments for cats with any kind of kidney disease is being on a restricted diet to help with their hydration as well as to decrease the toxin buildup in the blood. Cats with CKD fed a renal support diet
live twice as long
as cats fed a maintenance diet.
The most successful diets are veterinary diets like
Blue Buffalo Natural Veterinary Diet Kidney + Mobility Support
,
Royal Canin Renal Support
or
Hills k/d
.
These diets are restricted in protein and phosphorus to help decrease azotemia and low sodium to help with hydration.
They also contain amino acids (to help muscle mass) and
omega-3 fatty acids
(to support kidney health and decrease inflammation).
Antinausea medications such as Cerenia and antacids like
famotidine
are useful to help control
stomach upset
stemming from kidney disease.
Depending on your cats' symptoms other medications might be needed—such
appetite stimulants
(ex:
mirtazipine
) and blood pressure medication.
Purina Hydra Care
is an excellent supplement for cats with kidney disease. It’s designed to help your cat drink more water, which promotes kidney function.
Supplements can also be given to cats with kidney disease to help decrease their azotemia and promote kidney function such as
AminAvast
and
VetriScience
.
Speak with your veterinarian before giving your cat any supplements to ensure it is safe to give to them—they know your cat’s medical history best.
In many cases, hospitalization with intravenous (IV) fluids and the placement of a feeding tube can stabilize the cat.
Some respond well and may be able to return home for continued management of their underlying kidney disease.
For more intensive treatment, hemodialysis (treatment to filter a cat’s blood) is available. This will not cure kidney failure but may improve quality of life.
However, few veterinary clinics possess the necessary equipment, and the cost of hemodialysis for cats is very high.
This treatment requires working with a board-certified veterinary internal medicine specialist and consultation with a member of the
American Society of Veterinary Nephrology and Urology
.
Kidney transplant is another experimental route, but this has not widely been used and would require working with specialists to determine if your cat is a good candidate.
When a cat has kidney failure, it’s important to work closely with your veterinarian to discuss prognosis, strategies to monitor quality of life, and
when humane euthanasia should be considered
.
Recovery and Management of Kidney Failure in Cats
The prognosis for kidney failure in cats is poor.
At some point, medical management will not keep a cat comfortable and
end-of-life planning
will need to be discussed with your vet. This is one of the hardest decisions a pet parent can make.
Your veterinarian can help you understand questions about your cat’s quality of life. They’ll also help you develop a plan should humane euthanasia need to be considered outside of normal business hours.
How to Prevent Kidney Failure in Cats
While few types of kidney failure in cats can be prevented, unfortunately, most cases can’t.
However, kidney failure in cats due to toxin ingestion is highly preventable.
Never bring lilies—or bouquets of flowers including lilies—into the home because of their extreme toxicity to cats. All medications and cleaners should be kept in safe containers and away from places where a cat could get into them.
Limit your cat’s time in the garage, as chemicals like antifreeze can cause kidney failure in cats.
Most cases of kidney disease in cats are genetic, therefore the only way to control this is by
not breeding affected cats.
Kidney Failure in Cats FAQs
Is kidney failure in cats painful?
Cats with acute kidney failure are often in decent pain, due to kidney enlargement and abdominal distention.
Urinary issues—such as an obstruction or infection—are painful as well and can cause kidney disease.
With chronic kidney disease, it’s often a gradual change over many months to years, so it is less likely to be painful.
What is the life expectancy of cats with kidney failure?
Cats in stage 1 and 2 kidney failure can have a long life if treated appropriately.
These cats can live many years on a special diet and various medications and supplements as well as routine exams by their veterinarian to assess for any progression on disease.
Cats in stage 3 and 4 kidney failure require aggressive treatment and management, usually involving hospitalization.
Their life expectancy depends on what symptoms they have and how well they respond to treatment.
Humane euthanasia is often chosen for these cats with stage 3 or 4 kidney disease.
What are the early signs of kidney failure in cats?
The earliest sign of kidney disease in cats is polyuria and polydipsia (PU/PD).
Polyuria is an increase in frequency of urination. This can be in large or small amounts and can often cause a cat to have urinary accidents outside of the litterbox.
Polydipsia refers to a cats increase in thirst causing them to drink excessive amounts of water. This might even include a cat seeking water in bizarre places like
drinking from the toilet
or sink.
