Dr. Grota decided at an early age that she wanted to be a veterinarian. A native of Indiana, she grew up in a home where animals were members of the family. She spent Saturday mornings volunteering at the local humane society and loved having the opportunity to make a positive impact on stray animals and the community.
After receiving her Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from Purdue University in 1996, she and her husband lived in Richmond, Virginia where she joined a busy small animal practice. In 1998, Dr. Grota and her husband decided to return to the Midwest, specifically beautiful Door County, Wisconsin.
In 2007, Dr. Grota joined the Animal Clinic of Sturgeon Bay. She is honored to be part of a practice that strives to follow the Golden Rule, and she has enjoyed getting to know the clients and their pets. Dr. Grota particularly enjoys internal medicine, feline medicine, cardiology, and strengthening the bond between families and their pets.
She is a member of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Wisconsin Veterinary Medical Association, and the American Association of Feline Practitioners.
Dr. Grota spearheaded the effort to have the Animal Clinic of Sturgeon Bay certified as a Cat-Friendly Practice in 2014.
She completed training in 2017 to become a Fear Free Certified Professional and is a firm believer in the benefits of low-stress handling. In 2020, Dr. Grota also earned her Human-Animal Bond certification.
Dr. Grota and her husband share their home with their children, two dogs, four cats, three sheep, and a bunny—a full house indeed! Her hobbies include running, biking, hiking the many beautiful trails in Door County with her family, reading, playing the piano, and learning the ukulele and mandolin.
