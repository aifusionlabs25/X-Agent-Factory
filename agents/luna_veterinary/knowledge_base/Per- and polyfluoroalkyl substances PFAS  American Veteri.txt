Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large group of synthetic (human-made) chemicals valued for their resistance to water, oil, grease, and stains. These colorless, odorless, and highly stable compounds are found in a wide variety of products, including nonstick cookware, food packaging, cleaning products, cosmetics, plastics, electronics, water-repellent textiles, and firefighting foams.
1
PFAS do not easily break down when released into the environment and can build up in body tissues over time, posing risks to both human and animal health. In animals, PFAS exposure has been linked to health issues such as liver damage, immune system suppression, and developmental problems.
2
There are no known treatments for exposure in any species, so the best way to mitigate their effects on animal, public, and ecosystem health is to minimize exposure.
For these reasons and more, it's important that veterinarians understand the sources, exposure routes, and potential hazards of PFAS.
Where do PFAS come from?
PFAS are primarily released from manufacturing and industrial processes. Because they resist degradation, PFAS persist in the environment and can spread through water, soil, and air, leading to widespread contamination—even in remote ecosystems.
How are animals exposed to PFAS?
Animals can be exposed to PFAS through multiple pathways.
Water
Contaminated water can be a major source of exposure. PFAS can enter water supplies through runoff from manufacturing plants and other industrial facilities, landfills, and agricultural sites treated with biosolids or pesticides. Wildlife and aquatic animals (both wild and farmed) are especially vulnerable.
Diet
Plants can absorb PFAS from contaminated soil or water, introducing these chemicals into the food chain. Herbivores may ingest contaminated vegetation, and carnivores can be exposed through prey in which PFAS have
bioaccumulated
. These compounds can
biomagnify
, increasing in concentration further up the food chain.
Environment
Animals—whether livestock, wildlife, or companion animals—can encounter PFAS directly through contact with contaminated soil or indirectly via wind-blown particles, surface runoff, or groundwater. Animals kept indoors may be exposed via household items like carpets, upholstery, or even food and medication packaging.

How can PFAS affect animal health?
Our understanding of how PFAS may affect animal health is largely derived from toxicological studies as well as epidemiologic evidence in people. For people, PFAS have been linked to immune suppression (including vaccine inefficacy), increased cholesterol, reproductive issues, developmental disorders, increased risk of certain cancers, and other adverse health outcomes.
The available evidence suggests pets and other animals likely are susceptible to harmful effects from PFAS, although more studies are needed to determine the nature and frequency of these effects. Guidelines also are needed for interpreting results for animals of various standardized testing methods for PFAS.
Pets
Exposure to PFAS has been linked to elevated liver enzymes, cholesterol, and thyroid hormones in dogs and cats.
4,5
Preliminary evidence also suggests that hyperthyroidism may be associated with greater total serum PFAS concentrations in cats.
5
Fish
Most research on PFAS in fish has been focused on potential risks to people through fish consumption. The compounds accumulate in fish through both water and dietary exposure (bioaccumulation through the food chain). They have been found in various tissues, including whole body, muscle, blood, and liver samples, with highest concentrations found in blood and liver tissue.
6,7
Surveillance work is underway by federal and state agencies to better understand tissue PFAS concentrations in fish and what they may mean for human health.
8
Livestock
PFAS have been detected in the serum, liver, kidneys, and milk of farm animals including chickens, cattle, pigs, goats, and horses.
9,10
There also have been anecdotal reports of bovine mortality following exposure to contaminated water.
11
Besides the possible impacts of PFAS on the animals, food products derived from affected animals may pose an exposure pathway for people.
Wildlife
PFAS have been demonstrated in the tissues of multiple wildlife species worldwide, including in remote regions like the Arctic. The highest concentrations in wildlife are associated with proximity to PFAS-contaminated sites.
In terms of specific animals, elevated PFAS levels have been associated with an increased incidence of disease in sea otters,
12
increased risk of disease in dolphins,
13
decreased foraging behavior in crayfish,
14
reduced hatching success in sea turtles,
15
and autoimmune conditions in alligators.

What are governmental agencies doing about PFAS?
Federal and state agencies are monitoring, managing, and reducing PFAS contamination through testing programs, regulatory measures, public health initiatives, and environmental clean-up. Some examples:
Federal agencies
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):
The EPA has set a national drinking water standard for PFAS and taken steps to improve transparency around PFAS contamination clean-up work. The agency also conducts
National Aquatic Resource Surveys
, which involve monitoring fish from lakes and streams nationwide and testing PFAS levels in freshwater fish and shellfish. These surveys rely on local data to better inform safe consumption guidelines for locally caught fish and shellfish.

U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA):
The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) collaborates with the EPA and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure food products are safe for consumption and
comply with U.S. requirements
for veterinary drug residues, pesticide residues, and chemical contaminants. This includes testing for various PFAS to gain a better understanding of PFAS concentrations in selected meat products.
17
In addition, the USDA's Farm Service Agency offers indemnification payments through the
Dairy Indemnity Payment Program
for the loss of dairy cows or dairy products due to PFAS contamination. This program paid out approximately $1.5 million for PFAS claims in 2022.
FDA:
The FDA has completed a
voluntary market phase-out of PFAS use
on paper and paperboard food packaging, eliminating the primary source of dietary exposure to PFAS. The agency can now
test for dozens of PFAS
in a variety of food products. The agency has also conducted an
assessment of their use in medical devices
and has determined that the types of PFAS that are used in such devices pose no discernable risk for patients.
State programs
California:
The State Water Resources Control Board provides general background on PFAS, information on where PFAS data are being collected across the state, and links to other state entities implementing efforts on PFAS.
Michigan:
The Michigan PFAS Action Response Team (MPART) was established in 2017 to facilitate interagency coordination on addressing PFAS. This team works to identify PFAS contamination sites and collaborates with local health departments to sample water, conduct exposure and health studies, and inform and educate the public about PFAS.
Minnesota:
The state's Pollution Control Agency offers information on PFAS in fish, and the Department of Health offers Fish Consumption Guidance to help residents make informed choices to minimize their exposure to PFAS and other contaminants. They also have launched a
PFAS Blueprint
for preventing, managing, and cleaning up PFAS contamination across the state.
North Dakota:
The state's Water Resources Research Institute held the first North Dakota PFAS Conference in 2024 to raise awareness, share state-level research, and explore actions to address PFAS contamination.
Wisconsin:
The Wisconsin PFAS Action Council (WisPAC) coordinates statewide PFAS-related initiatives and developed the
Wisconsin PFAS Action Plan
as a roadmap for how state agencies will address PFAS. In addition, the state's Department of Natural Resources launched an interactive
PFAS Data Viewer
that maps contamination sites across the state.
