Attention Georgia Pet Parents and Veterinary Professionals
Due to a recently passed Senate Bill 105 in the state of Georgia regarding veterinary teletriage and telemedicine, Pet Poison Helpline will no longer be able to provide risk assessments or treatment guidance to pet parents directly regarding their pet as of July 1
st
, 2025. If you are a pet parent, you may choose to start a case by providing basic information regarding your pet and the assessment or concern can be discussed with your veterinarian or you may choose to have your veterinarian contact us directly to start a case. Pet Poison Helpline is still able to provide guidance and support to your veterinarian regarding your pet’s needs.
Was your pet just exposed to something harmful? Contact your veterinarian or call/chat with Pet Poison Helpline® immediately. The sooner an exposure or poisoning is addressed, the easier, less expensive, and safer it is to treat.
$89 fee
When you call or chat with one of our staff experts, a $89 USD per incident fee applies. All follow-up consultations are included.
