View 3 More + Whether cooling down your dog on a hot summer day or helping with an injury, an ice pack can be a great option to soothe your pup. There are many ice packs for dogs available—they can be soft or firm, be moldable around a limb or joint, or even be part of a special cooling vest your pet can wear. Here’s what to know about canine ice packs. Key Takeaways Ice packs can help dogs by reducing inflammation, pain, swelling, and discomfort from injuries, surgery sites, and certain medical conditions. They’re also used for managing mild overheating in dogs. Always wrap an ice pack in a towel to protect your dog’s skin and only apply the pack for 10–20 minutes at a time. Supervise your dog during use and avoid ice packs made with gel or gel beads, which can be toxic for dogs. Homemade dog ice packs made with ice cubes and a towel are safe alternatives. What Are the Benefits of Ice Packs for Dogs? When applied to a dog’s skin, an ice pack provides cold therapy, or cryotherapy. Cold therapy constricts blood vessels, decreasing blood flow to an injured area. This helps reduce pain , inflammation, and swelling. An ice pack can be used for both acute situations and longer-term chronic conditions. Using a canine ice pack is often recommended for: Bug bites and stings Burns Wounds on the skin or in deeper tissues (ex: muscle, soft tissue, or bone) Surgical incisions Hot spots Joint pain (secondary to arthritis or joint disease ) Overheating or heat stress Are There Risks When Using Ice Packs on Dogs? When using a cold pack for dogs, there are a few safety considerations to keep in mind: Make sure the ice pack doesn’t have any holes, which can cause the inside material to leak as it starts melting. While the inside of an ice pack made with water might be safe for your dog to ingest, others are made with gel or gel beads that might be toxic for your dog. Use an ice pack made specifically for dogs in case a leak does happen. These are less likely to contain toxic materials for pups. Supervise your dog so they don’t chew on the ice pack and cause a leak. Use a clean, dry towel between the ice pack and your dog’s skin. This stops your pup from getting too cold and protects their skin from infection, especially if you’re treating a wound. Don’t leave the ice pack on your dog for too long. This can cause skin damage and delay healing. How To Use Ice Packs for Dogs The best ice pack for dogs is one made from water (no gel or gel beads) and wrapped in a towel. For Injuries, Inflammation, and Pain Place the ice pack on the affected area. Typically, you can use the ice pack in 10- to 20-minute intervals if your dog tolerates it. Using an ice pack isn’t something that necessarily needs to be done under a veterinarian’s guidance. But if your dog is experiencing pain or inflammation, has a wound, or is limping and you find yourself using an ice pack multiples times a day for more than 48 hours, take them to the vet to determine and treat the underlying cause. For Overheating If your dog is overheating (signs include excessive panting and drooling , changes in gum color , vomiting , and diarrhea ), take their temperature . If they have a mild temperature (103–104.5 F) but are eating, drinking, eliminating, and acting normally, at-home cooling methods are OK. Apply an ice pack to their paws, neck, armpits, or groin, or use a dog cooling vest to help cool them down. Provide fresh cold water and air conditioning or shade. Provide a water bowl with fresh cold water and air conditioning or shade. If your dog’s temperature is over 105 F or if they are acting unusual, seek veterinary care right away.
