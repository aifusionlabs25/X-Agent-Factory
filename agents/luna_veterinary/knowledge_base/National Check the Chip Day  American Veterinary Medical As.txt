National Check the Chip Day
Microchips greatly increase the chances that pets will be reunited with their families if they are lost or stolen…but a microchip only works if its registration information is accurate.
To remind pet owners
to have their pets microchipped and to keep the registration information up-to-date
, AVMA and the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) joined together to create Check the Chip Day. With support from HomeAgain, the AVMA develops materials to promote the event.
Are you a pet owner?
Microchips reunite pets with families. Check the registration information for your pet's microchip once a year on Check the Chip Day.
If your pet isn’t already microchipped, make an appointment with your veterinarian now for microchipping. Register your pets chip immediately with the manufacturer, making sure all of your contact information is included.
Ask your veterinarian to scan the microchip during your pet's annual wellness exam every year.
Each year on Check the Chip Day, check your pet's microchip registration information and update it if it's incomplete or no longer correct.
Updating your pet's microchip registration
To update your pet's registration, you’ll need your pet's microchip number. If you haven’t already created an account with the manufacturer, you’ll need to do that as well. Make sure that all of the information is correct, especially your phone number(s) and address.
There are many databases that allow you to register your pet's microchip, but the one that really counts—the one that animal shelters and veterinarians will search—is the database maintained by the manufacturer of your pet's microchip. You can quickly search the registries of most microchip manufacturers using the
universal lookup tool
provided by the AAHA. There also are public microchip registries that have been linked to the AAHA tool to make it easier to find a microchip's registration.
