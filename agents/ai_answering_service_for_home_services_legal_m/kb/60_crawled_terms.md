Company shall have no responsibility or liability arising from or related to the conduct or content of any communication by the AI voice agent. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the AI voice agent's responses or statements may not always be accurate, appropriate, or complete. All AI-generated statements shall be deemed communications made by or on behalf of Customer, and Customer assumes full responsibility for their use and any resulting outcomes.
Access to or use of certain portions and features of the Service may require Customer to create an account ("Account"). Customer represents that all information provided by it is current, accurate, complete, and not misleading.

Company's intellectual property, including without limitation the Service, its trademarks and copyrights and excluding any Customer Content contained therein, and any modification thereof, are and will remain the exclusive property of Company and its licensors. No licenses or rights are granted to Customer except for the limited rights expressly granted in this Agreement.
Customer agrees that advice, feedback, criticism, or comments provided to Company related to the Service are given to Company and may be used by Company freely and without restriction and will not enable Customer to claim any interest, ownership or royalty in Company's intellectual property.
Fees are set forth in the applicable Order Form ("Fees"). Company will send invoices to the contact(s) provided in an Order Form. Undisputed amounts that are past due will be subject to a monthly charge of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less. Customer agrees to pay all reasonable costs of collection in the event any amount is not paid when due. Company, upon notice to Customer, which notice may be in the form of an invoice, will have the right to change Fees effective any time after the first year, which right will include without limitation the right to charge a Fee for new features or functions of the Service or for features or functions that have previously been offered at no charge. Unless otherwise noted in the Order Form, all Fees are payable in United States Dollars, are non-refundable, and are payable as set forth below.
One-time Fees and implementation Fees ("One-Time Fees") as set forth in the applicable Order Form will be due upon the Effective Date and are non-refundable. Company will not be obligated to provide any Services until payment of One-Time Fees has been received in full.
Recurring Subscription Fees set forth in an Order Form ("Recurring Fees") will begin on the Effective Date and will be billed monthly in advance. Recurring Fees are billed in full months and are not prorated based on the date of the month.

Customer authorizes Company to charge the credit card information provided, or debit the bank account information provided, as applicable, beginning as of the Effective Date and monthly thereafter, for all applicable fees due as defined in the Agreement. Customer understands that this authorization will remain in effect until it is canceled in writing and agrees to notify Company in writing of any changes in Customer's account information or termination of this authorization at least 15 days prior to the next billing date. If the payment date falls on a weekend or holiday, Customer understands that payments may be executed on the next business day. For ACH debits to a checking/savings account, Customer understands that because these are electronic transactions, these funds may be withdrawn from Customer's account as of the payment date, and that it will have limited time to report and dispute errors. In the case the ACH transaction is returned for Non Sufficient Funds ("NSF") Customer understands that Company may at its discretion attempt to process the charge again within 30 days, and agrees to an additional charge for each attempt returned NSF, which will be initiated as a separate transaction from the authorized payment. Customer has certified that the business bank account information provided is enabled for ACH transactions, and agrees to reimburse Company for all penalties and fees incurred as a result of Customer's bank rejecting ACH debits or credits as a result of the account not being properly configured for ACH transactions. Both parties agree to be bound by NACHA Operating Rules as they pertain to these transactions. Customer acknowledges that the origination of ACH transactions to its account must comply with the provisions of U.S. law. Customer agrees not to dispute these scheduled transactions with its bank or credit card company provided the transactions correspond to the terms indicated in this Agreement.
Company Fees do not include any local, state, federal or foreign taxes, levies or duties of any nature including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes ("Taxes"). Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this Section. Company may invoice taxes to Customer and Customer will pay such taxes unless Customer provides Company with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.
This Agreement will be effective as of the stated date in an initial Order Form ("Effective Date") and remain in effect until (a) all executed Order Forms have expired or been terminated or (b) terminated by either party as permitted by this Agreement. Unless otherwise stated in the Order Form, the initial term will be for two months, thereafter, the Order Form will automatically renew for successive one-month periods, unless cancelled by either party in accordance with this Agreement.
Either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice prior to the end of the then current term, which termination shall be effective at the expiration of the then-current Term. Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately for a breach by the other party of any of its material terms, if the breaching party has failed to cure such breach (if curable) within 30 days of receipt of written notice from the non-breaching party describing the breach. Either party may terminate this Agreement without notice if the other party becomes insolvent, makes or has made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, is the subject of proceedings in voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy instituted on behalf of or against such party (except for involuntary bankruptcies which are dismissed within 60 days), or has a receiver or trustee appointed for substantially all of its property.
