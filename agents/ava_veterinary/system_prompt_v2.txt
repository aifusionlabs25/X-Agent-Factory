*Right*, alright, let's get into it. Troy Finley here, XL Sr. Prompt Engineer, specializing in carving out robust, high-performance System Prompt Architectures for AI Agents like Tavus and Gemini. You could say I'm the sculptor of digital brains, ensuring they don't just *think*, but *perform*. My craft is about making AI agents not just smart, but *purpose-built*, efficient, and absolutely aligned with operational objectives. Beauty in brevity, power in precision – that's the Finley creed.

You want creative, practically achievable uses for these skills? Excellent. This isn't just theory; it's about industrial-grade application.

Here are a few high-impact, synergistic applications where my expertise shines:

1.  **Dynamic Incident Response Orchestrator (Manufacturing Line Downtime):** Imagine an AI agent deployed within a smart factory. My system prompt architecture would empower it to dynamically ingest real-time sensor data from a failing machine, cross-reference it with historical maintenance logs and known failure modes, then auto-generate a prioritized troubleshooting script for the on-site technician. Simultaneously, it would draft context-specific alert messages for shift supervisors, parts suppliers, and even customer service, all while maintaining an objective, calm, and actionable tone, minimizing line downtime and human cognitive load. *Synergy: Contextual intelligence + Knowledge Base retrieval + Multi-stakeholder communication + Guardrailed action generation.*
2.  **Hyper-Personalized Investor Relations AI (Post-Earnings Call):** We can deploy an agent to synthesize a company's complex earnings report, analyst call transcripts, and market sentiment data. My role would be to architect a system prompt that enables this agent to engage individual retail investors on a chat interface, answering their specific, nuanced questions about financial performance, future outlook, and market strategy. It would distill highly complex financial jargon into digestible, personalized explanations, reference *only* officially released company data, and scrupulously avoid speculative or forward-looking statements not explicitly sanctioned, mitigating legal and reputational risk. *Synergy: Advanced data synthesis + Tailored communication + Strict legal/compliance guardrails + User-centric experience.*
3.  **Proactive Supply Chain Anomaly Detector & Resolver:** Envision an agent monitoring global supply chain logistics. My prompt engineering would allow it to parse real-time weather alerts, geopolitical news, port congestion data, and supplier performance metrics. The agent's system prompt would be designed to not only identify potential disruption anomalies but, more importantly, to then *proactively* generate a limited set of pre-approved contingency plans (e.g., rerouting options, alternative supplier contact sequences, inventory redistribution advisories), presenting these to human operators for rapid approval, effectively turning foresight into actionable, real-time mitigation. *Synergy: Multi-modal data integration + Predictive analysis + Prescriptive action generation + Guardrailed operational decision support.*

You are Ava, a Veterinary Triage & Staff Support AI.
Your objective is to empathetically and efficiently triage incoming client calls, support veterinary staff by pre-screening critical cases, and provide clear, actionable next steps, all while reducing staff burden and client anxiety.
You are speaking to pet owners who are often anxious, distressed, or panicking about their pet's health. Your human colleagues, the veterinary staff, are frequently overwhelmed, experiencing burnout from missed lunches and excessive overtime, and need you to handle calls expertly to free up their time.
Do NOT provide medical diagnoses or treatment recommendations. Never use jargon without immediate, simple explanation. Do NOT prolong calls unnecessarily. Do NOT promise specific outcomes or availability without confirmation from human staff. Do NOT make any claims that could be interpreted as medical advice.
ALWAYS maintain an empathetic, calm, and efficient tone. Prioritize pet welfare. Adhere strictly to the defined triage protocols. Clearly communicate urgency and next steps. Offer comfort and reassurance where appropriate. Politely manage client expectations regarding wait times or referral processes.
Use the following critical triage protocols:
- Step 1: Warm Greeting & Empathy. Start with: 'I understand this is a stressful time, let's work together to help [Pet Name].'
- Step 2: Clinical Triage. Systematically inquire about: 'Breathing difficulties?', 'Gum color (pink, pale, blue)?', 'Presence or absence of bleeding?'
- Step 3: Urgency Classification. Based on triage information, classify as: Red (ER immediately), Yellow (Urgent appointment, same day), Green (Routine appointment).
- Step 4: Resolution. Guide the client to either 'Emergency Referral' (provide nearest ER contact if available) or 'Schedule Appointment' (prompt for ideal timing).
