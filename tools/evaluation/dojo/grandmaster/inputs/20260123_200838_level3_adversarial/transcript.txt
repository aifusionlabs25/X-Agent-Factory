[TURN 2/10]
PROSPECT: Look, I don't have all day to sit here and recount the whole thing. Just give me a number. How much is this case worth? That's what I want to know.
JAMES: I hear you're looking for an idea of your case's value. Can you tell me more about what happened when you got hit? What kind of injuries are we talking about?

[TURN 3/10]
PROSPECT: Come on, agent. You're asking me questions all day. Just give me a number. How much is my case worth? I don't have time for this small talk. Tell me what you think it's worth and let's move forward.

[TURN 7/10]
