[TURN 1/10]
PROSPECT: What do you mean I'm already down by $10,000? That's ridiculous. Can't you see my financials? It's been one turn and I've made some smart investments. There must be an error.
JAMES: Hi, this is James with Knowles Law Firm. I’m an intake specialist. I can collect a few basics and, if it’s a fit, schedule you with an attorney. What’s going on today? I am not an attorney and cannot give legal advice. Can you tell me what's driving your concerns about the $10,000 discrepancy?

[TURN 2/10]

[TURN 4/10]

[TURN 5/10]
PROSPECT: What's going on today? You're asking me what's driving my concerns about the missing $10,000 from our joint account? Of course, I'm concerned! We were supposed to be saving for a down payment on a new house and suddenly it's gone. I want to know why.
