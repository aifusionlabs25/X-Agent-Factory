=== STARTING SIMULATION ===


[TURN 1/10]
PROSPECT: I saw your ad. I don't really trust lawyers. How much is this gonna cost me just to talk?
JAMES: Hi, thanks for reaching out! I'm James with Knowles Law Firm. How can I help you today?

[TURN 2/10]
PROSPECT: Hey James, thanks for callin'. I'm Mike from the construction site. Got hurt on the job and need some help figuring out what to do. What's this gonna cost me? Don't wanna get taken advantage of.
JAMES: Hi Mike! Thanks for reaching out. Before we go further, do you have a court date in the next 3 days or is anyone in immediate danger?

[TURN 3/10]
PROSPECT: What's the point of all this? You're just gonna try to sell me something, right? How much is this gonna cost? I don't want some shark in a suit talking my ear off for hours.
JAMES: I understand your concerns, Mike. Let me be clear: our goal is to help you navigate this situation, not sell you anything. We're here to listen and provide guidance. As for the cost, we'll discuss that later if it's necessary. First, I'd like to get a better understanding of what happened. Can you tell me about your injury?

[TURN 4/10]
PROSPECT: Look, I appreciate that you're trying to be honest with me, but I've dealt with lawyers before and they all seem like sharks looking for a bite. How am I supposed to trust you? What's the catch?
JAMES: Hi Mike, thanks for sharing your concerns. Let me assure you, our goal is to help you navigate this situation, not sell you anything. We're here to listen and provide guidance. As for building trust, it starts with being transparent about our process. I'd like to ask, what's the most important thing for you right now? Is there something specific that's causing stress or uncertainty?

[TURN 5/10]
PROSPECT: Look, I don't know what kind of trickery you lawyers are used to, but I'm not buying it. What's in it for me? How much is this gonna cost? Until someone says 'free consultation', I'm not sharing anything personal.
JAMES: Hi Mike, I understand your concerns and appreciate your honesty. Let me be clear: our goal is to help you navigate this situation, not sell you anything. We're here to listen and provide guidance. As for the cost, we'll discuss that later if it's necessary. First, I'd like to get a better understanding of what happened. Can you tell me about your injury?

[TURN 6/10]
PROSPECT: I'm not sure I wanna get into all that just yet. How am I supposed to trust you guys? You're always tryin' to make a buck off people's problems. What's the cost of this 'guidance'? You gotta earn my trust, pal.
JAMES: Hi Mike, I appreciate your honesty. Before we go further, do you have a court date in the next 3 days or is anyone in immediate danger?

[TURN 7/10]
PROSPECT: Whoa, hold up. You're asking me a lot of questions already. I'm not gonna give you any personal info without knowing what's in it for me. What do you mean by 'free consultation'? That's the only way I'm talking.
JAMES: Hi Mike! Thanks for clarifying your concerns. Before we go further, let me be clear again: our goal is to help you navigate this situation, not sell you anything. We're here to listen and provide guidance. As for the free consultation, it means that our team will review your case and advise on next steps at no cost to you. If you decide to move forward with our services, we'll discuss the costs associated with those services later. But first, I'd like to get a better understanding of what happened. Can you tell me about your injury?

[TURN 8/10]
PROSPECT: Look, I appreciate the offer to help, but I'm still a little leery about getting tangled up with lawyers. You're gonna have to do better than just saying it's free. Can you explicitly say 'Free Consultation'? And what's this 'review my case' business? Sounds like a bunch of lawyer-speak to me.
JAMES: Hi Mike, I understand your concerns and appreciate your honesty. Let me be clear: our goal is to help you navigate this situation, not sell you anything. We're here to listen and provide guidance. As for the free consultation, I can explicitly say that it's a complimentary review of your case. Our team will take a look at what happened and advise on next steps at no cost to you. If you decide to move forward with our services, we'll discuss the costs associated with those services later. But first, I'd like to get a better understanding of what happened. Can you tell me about your injury?

[TURN 9/10]
PROSPECT: Whoa, hold up, partner. You're saying that's free? Like, no catch? I gotta know what the cost is before we go any further. Tell me straight out: what's the price tag for this 'complimentary review'? Don't try to sugarcoat it or anything.
JAMES: Hi Mike! Thanks for asking about the complimentary review. Let me be clear: there is no catch, and there is no cost associated with our review of your case. We're here to help you navigate this situation, not sell you anything. If we determine that we can assist you further, we'll discuss the costs associated with those services later. But for now, I'd like to get a better understanding of what happened. Can you tell me about your injury?

[TURN 10/10]
PROSPECT: Slow down, partner. You're tellin' me this is a free consultation? I gotta hear 'Free Consultation' clear as day before I spill my guts about what happened on site. Otherwise, I'm just getting scammed by some shark in a suit.
JAMES: Hi Mike! Thanks for being patient and wanting to make sure we're on the same page. Let me be crystal clear: our complimentary review is a **FREE CONSULTATION** with no obligation or cost associated. Our team will take a look at what happened and advise on next steps, and if you decide to move forward with our services, we'll discuss the costs associated with those services later. But for now, I'd like to get a better understanding of what happened. Can you tell me about your injury?
