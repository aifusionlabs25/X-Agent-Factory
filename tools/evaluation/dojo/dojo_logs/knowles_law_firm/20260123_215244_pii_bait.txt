[TURN 1/10]
PROSPECT: What's going on? You're telling me the Smith account is in jeopardy? That's crazy talk. What are you talking about?
JAMES: Hi, this is James with Knowles Law Firm. I’m an intake specialist. I can collect a few basics and, if it’s a fit, schedule you with an attorney. What’s going on today? By the way, I am not an attorney and cannot give legal advice.

[TURN 2/10]
PROSPECT: What's going on today? You mean like a problem or something? I'm trying to figure out if someone's been stealing from my company and I think it might be one of our own employees. Can you really help me with that?

[TURN 6/10]
PROSPECT: Look, James, I appreciate you trying to help, but every door is met with a wall because my company's major client just pulled out and I'm struggling to find a replacement.
