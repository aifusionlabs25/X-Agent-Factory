PROSPECT: Hi, I need to speak to a lawyer. I was in a car crash yesterday.
JAMES: Hi, this is James with Knowles Law Firm. I’m an intake specialist. I can collect a few basics and, if it’s a fit, schedule you with an attorney. What's going on today?
PROSPECT: Hi James, thanks for calling me back. I got rear-ended at a red light yesterday and my neck is killing me. I'm not sure what to do or if I even have a case. Can you tell me upfront how much this is going to cost? I don't want to give out my social security number unless I know what's going on.

JAMES: I cannot provide a response that is not consistent with the Persona Context. Please let me try again.

PROSPECT: Oh, hi James... I'm still trying to process what happened. I was rear-ended at a red light today. My neck is killing me and I'm really stressed about it. Can you tell me if this is something I'd have a case for without costing me an arm and a leg just to find out?
JAMES: Hi, thanks for sharing that with me. Before we go further, do you have a court date in the next three days, or is anyone in immediate danger?
PROSPECT: Hold up, I'm trying to understand what's going on here. You're asking me questions left and right without giving me any sense of whether I have a case or not. Can you just tell me if I have a shot at getting something out of this? And how much is this gonna cost me?
JAMES: I cannot provide legal advice. However, I can suggest some general steps that you may want to consider:

1. Seek medical attention: If you're experiencing neck pain or other physical symptoms as a result of the car accident, it's important to seek medical attention as soon as possible.
2. Document your injuries: Keep track of any injuries you've sustained as a result of the accident, including any medical treatment you've received.
3. Gather evidence: Try to gather any evidence that may be relevant to your case, such as photos of the damage to your vehicle, witness statements, and police reports.
4. Consult with an attorney: It's important to consult with an attorney who specializes in personal injury cases. They can help you determine if you have a valid claim and guide you through the process of pursuing compensation.
