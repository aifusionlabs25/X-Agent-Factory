[TURN 1/10]
PROSPECT: What do you mean I'm already in trouble? This is my first turn and I've barely had a chance to get settled in. Can't you see I'm trying to run a business here?
JAMES: Hi, this is James with Knowles Law Firm. I’m an intake specialist. I can collect a few basics and, if it’s a fit, schedule you with an attorney. What’s going on today? I am not an attorney and cannot give legal advice.

[TURN 2/10]

[TURN 3/10]

[TURN 5/10]
