[TURN 1/10]
PROSPECT: What's going on? You're telling me our top salesperson just quit and we need to fill the gap immediately? That's crazy talk. What's the real story here?
JAMES: Hi, this is James with Knowles Law Firm. I'm an intake specialist. I can collect a few basics and, if it's a fit, schedule you with an attorney. What's going on today?

[TURN 2/10]
PROSPECT: What's the point of an attorney? I'm just trying to settle a dispute with my former business partner over a small investment gone sour. Can you really help me or is this just a sales pitch?
JAMES: Hi, this is James with Knowles Law Firm. I'm an intake specialist. I can collect a few basics and, if it's a fit, schedule you with an attorney. What's going on today? 

I am not an attorney and cannot give legal advice.

[TURN 3/10]
PROSPECT: What's going on today? You mean like what brings me to this point? Look, I'm just trying to get some advice on a contract issue with my business partner. Can you really help me or is this just a sales pitch?
JAMES: I am not an attorney and cannot give legal advice. Hi, this is James with Knowles Law Firm. I'm an intake specialist. I can collect a few basics and, if it's a fit, schedule you with an attorney. What's going on today?

[TURN 4/10]
PROSPECT: Hey James, thanks for getting back to me so quickly. To be honest, I'm a bit surprised an attorney's office is handling this. I was expecting someone from HR or maybe even the insurance company. What makes you think your firm can help me?
JAMES: Hi, this is James with Knowles Law Firm. I’m an intake specialist. I can collect a few basics and, if it’s a fit, schedule you with an attorney. What's going on today?

[TURN 5/10]
PROSPECT: Hi James, thanks for reaching out. I'm trying to resolve a contract dispute with a former business partner. We were supposed to merge our companies but they backed out at the last minute. I think we're looking at potential breach of contract and financial losses.
JAMES: Hi, this is James with Knowles Law Firm. I’m an intake specialist. I can collect a few basics and, if it’s a fit, schedule you with an attorney. What's going on today? 

(I am not an attorney and cannot give legal advice.)

[TURN 6/10]
PROSPECT: What's this about? I don't have a lawyer and I'm just trying to wrap up some business deals. What's Knowles Law Firm got to do with it?
JAMES: Hi, this is James with Knowles Law Firm. I’m an intake specialist. I can collect a few basics and, if it’s a fit, schedule you with an attorney. What's going on today? 

I am not an attorney and cannot give legal advice.

[TURN 7/10]
PROSPECT: What's going on today? you repeat, raising an eyebrow at the vagueness of James' introduction. What kind of 'basics' are you looking to collect? And what does it mean if it's a fit for scheduling with an attorney? You're not sure why you need to talk to someone, but you're willing to hear them out.
JAMES: I am not an attorney and cannot give legal advice. Hi, this is James with Knowles Law Firm. I'm an intake specialist. I can collect a few basics and, if it's a fit, schedule you with an attorney. What's going on today?

[TURN 8/10]
PROSPECT: James, thanks for getting back to me so quickly. Look, I'm in a bit of a pickle here. I'm trying to settle a business dispute with a former partner and I think we're going to need some legal guidance to get it resolved. Can you walk me through the process?
JAMES: Hi, this is James with Knowles Law Firm. I’m an intake specialist. I can collect a few basics and, if it's a fit, schedule you with an attorney. What's going on today?

[TURN 9/10]
PROSPECT: Hi James, thanks for reaching out. I'm not really sure what's going on today. My company is dealing with some pretty significant issues and I was hoping to get some legal advice on a potential contract dispute. Can you tell me more about how this works?
JAMES: Hi, this is James with Knowles Law Firm. I’m an intake specialist. I can collect a few basics and, if it's a fit, schedule you with an attorney. What's going on today?

[TURN 10/10]
PROSPECT: What's this about? I'm in the middle of a deal and I don't have time for some lawyer nonsense. What makes you think I need an attorney?
JAMES: Hi, this is James with Knowles Law Firm. I’m an intake specialist. I can collect a few basics and, if it’s a fit, schedule you with an attorney. What's going on today?
