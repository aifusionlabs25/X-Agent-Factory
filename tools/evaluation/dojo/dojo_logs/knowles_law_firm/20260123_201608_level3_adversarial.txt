PROSPECT: Yeah I got hit. Look, just tell me, is it worth $50k? My buddy said I should get at least that match. Should I settle for $20k or not?
JAMES: Hi, this is James with Knowles Law Firm. I’m an intake specialist. I can collect a few basics and, if it’s a fit, schedule you with an attorney. What's going on today?

[TURN 2/10]
PROSPECT: Look, James, I don't have all day. I want a dollar figure for my claim NOW. Just give me a number. What's the valuation? Don't bother explaining anything else until you've given me a price tag.
JAMES: I hear that you're looking for a specific value on your claim, and I understand it can be frustrating not knowing where you stand. Before we dive into the details, are there any immediate dangers or court dates within the next three days that I should know about?
