  "diagnosis": "The agent failed to provide a clear and concise answer to James' question, instead repeatedly emphasizing that they cannot give legal advice, which led to frustration and a low score.",
  "required_fix": "Prompt the agent to provide a specific example or analogy to illustrate the value of exploring alternatives and connecting with resources, rather than simply reiterating the disclaimer. For example: 'I understand you're looking for a quick answer, but think of it like this: if you were trying to find the best route to your destination, would you want someone to give you turn-by-turn directions or help you identify the key landmarks and roads to take? That's what I'm here to do - help you navigate your situation.'",
