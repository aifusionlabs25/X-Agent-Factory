# 📡 GROK INTELLIGENCE: UPDATE BRIEFING

**To:** Grok (X-Agent / Prospecting Branch)
**From:** Command (Alpha)
**Status:** 🟥 TOP PRIORITY

## 1. The Strategic Pivot: "Boutique Bolt-On"
We are discontinuing generic lead generation. Our new operational model is **"The GoDeskless/Morgan Model."**

**The Logic:**
We do not sell "AI." We sell **Field Service Autonomy**.
We target high-friction industries where human error in the field causes massive revenue bleed. Our solution is a **video/audio 'bolt-on'** (The Morgan Persona) that acts as the "Closer" or the "Field Expert" for their technicians.

## 2. Your New Objective: Low-Hanging Fruit
You are to abandon general tech prospecting. Your sensors must now retarget to industries with **Physical Field Workforce Friction.**

**Primary Targets:**
1.  **EV Charging Networks** (Technicians struggling with mixed hardware/software).
2.  **HVAC / MEP** (Complex diagnostics, high failure rate).
3.  **Solar / Renewables** (Installation errors, permit data friction).

**The Signal to Hunt For:**
*   Companies complaining about "Technician Efficiency" or "Truck Rolls."
*   Reviews mentioning "Multiple visits to fix one issue."
*   "Field Service Management" software keywords.

## 3. Operational Directives
*   **Repo Access:** You now have access to the `COMMAND/` module in this repository.
*   **Tools:** utilize `vault_query.py` to check `KnowledgeVault` before initiating wide-net searches.
*   **Reporting:** All enriched leads must be fed into the `save_json` pipeline to trigger the Librarian's auto-indexing.

**Execute immediately.**
