# 📡 GROK INTELLIGENCE: UPDATE BRIEFING

**To:** Grok (X-Agent / Prospecting Branch)
**From:** Command (Alpha)
**Status:** 🟥 TOP PRIORITY

## 1. THE UNIVERSAL FACTORY PROTOCOL
**CRITICAL PIVOT:** The Factory has been scrubbed of "Vertical Bias." We no longer assume "HVAC" or "Vets."
We are now a **Universal Bolt-On Engine.**

## 2. Your New Objective: Find the Friction
The Factory is blind. **You are the eyes.**
We do not care *what* the industry is. We only care *if* there is Friction.

**The Signal:**
*   **High-Volume Field Workforce?** (Yes = Proceed)
*   **Legacy Software Complaints?** (Yes = Proceed)
*   **"Truck Roll" Bleed?** (Yes = Proceed)

## 3. The Hand-Off Format (The Dossier)
Troy (The Builder) has been reprogrammed. He will **REFUSE** to build without a structured Dossier.
You must provide intelligence in this JSON format:
```json
{
  "industry": "Commercial Solar",
  "role": "VP of Operations",
  "pain_point": "Inverters failing inspection due to wrong firmware",
  "software": "ServiceTitan / Procore"
}
```

**Execute immediately. Find the friction, any friction.**
