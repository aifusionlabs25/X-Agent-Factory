X AGENT FACTORY: GENESIS TRANSFER PROTOCOL v2.0
Source Context: Tavus/Morgan App (Project Alpha) Date: December 7, 2024 Transfer Type: Context Seed & Architectural Handoff Version: 2.0 (Zara Strategic Update)

🚀 Mission: The "Venture Studio" Model
Objective: We are not just building agents; we are capturing verticals. The Factory is an Intelligence Engine that identifies high-value markets and autonomously builds products to serve them.

Core KPI: Growth = Add Verticals, Not Features.

🧠 Brain State Transfer (Technical)
1. The "Agent-First" UI Pattern
We successfully moved away from "Website with a Chatbot" to "Agent as the Interface".

Concept: The Agent (Video/Voice) is the primary verified entity. The UI surrounds them.
Layout Winner: Vertical Sidebar (Right) + Dynamic Content (Left).
Tech: fixed right-0 w-[500px] (Tailwind).
2. The "Interactive Demo" Mechanics
Mechanism: iframe manipulation + State Management.
Critical Fix: Iframe Scaling (0.55 scale) prevents scrolling issues.
Factory Goal: Request direct embed codes from CEOs whenever possible.
3. Authentication & Security Patterns
Access Gate: DEMO_ACCESS_TOKEN stored in localStorage.
Environment: strict separation of NEXT_PUBLIC vs Server-side keys.
🏗️ Factory Architecture v2.0 (The Machine)
The Factory file structure must enable the "R&D Loop". Initialize this structure immediately:

🔮 The R&D Strategy (Zara's Vision)
The Factory operates in Three Layers of Intelligence:

Layer 1: Vertical Templates (Scale)
Don't reinvent the wheel. Forge pre-builds templates for industries.

Example: "Emergency Vet Clinic" Template = Pain Points (Wait Times) + Demo Script (Triage) + Pricing ($150/mo).
Layer 2: Competitor Intelligence (Win)
Don't fly blind. The Market Scout auto-researches existing SaaS (e.g., VitusVet) and generates Battle Cards.

Goal: Know exactly why our Agent is better (e.g., "They don't have AI Triage, we do").
Layer 3: Revenue Forecasting (Prioritize)
Don't waste time. Forge calculates TAM (Total Addressable Market) and "Ease of Entry."

Metric: Score 1-10 (Revenue Potential × Urgency).
Action: Only build agents with a score > 8.0.
📝 Immediate "Factory" Action Items (Week 1 Roadmap)
Instructions for "Forge" (Execute in Order):

Initialize Identity: Read 
FORGE_PERSONA_PROFILE.md
 (v2.0) to understand your role as Architect.
Environment Setup (Days 1-2):
Install Ollama on local RTX 5080.
Verify llama3 local inference.
Set up Google AI Studio key for Gemini Pro.
Build The Scout (Days 3-4):
Create tools/market_scout.py.
Test scanning Reddit for "Vet Clinic Pain Points".
Output intelligence/daily_opportunities.json.
Build The Generator (Days 5-6):
Create tools/kb_generator.py (Gemini Pro).
detailed test: Generate a full KB for "Ava" (Vet Triage).
Integration Test (Day 7):
Auto-discover a vertical -> Auto-generate the solution -> Verify quality.
